Here are the BludBol Basics:

* 11 people on the field at a time.
* One team kicks the ball to the other. The receiving team tries to carry or throw that ball to the other end of the field to score a touchdown (TD) while the defense tries to stop them.
* The scoring team then kicks to the other team who tries to do the same thing.
* There are two halves of equal length.
* Injuries are common, and are tracked as Casualties (Cas).

You can look up a lot of stuff on EDS. What are you focusing on once you get the basic rules of the game?

Bludbol teams can have a maximum of 16 players, and only a maximum of 11 can be on the field at a time. Teams are limited in the numbers of specialists they can play, and how those specialists (and the grunts on the line) are trained and able to play leads to different strategies being crystallized.

Some playbooks are named for old coaches, some for strategies, but the idea is that every team playing the Hermann playbook would at least resemble each other.

There are playbooks based around scoring on the run, long passing, short passing and lots of variations of bashing the opponents into submission.

The original UBBL (Underground BludBol League) began when the Old Wyrms and Zensun Vagabonds got the various street ball competitors organized after the Mass Elevator project was completed. The league had between 8 and 11 teams in its first four seasons, and some of the players got very good. Halfleg Jack, Sardines, Lophand were some of the biggest stars, but there aren't very good records of what were essentially squatter games, nothing like the Upper Colonial League.

Old-era UBBL stats are hard to find in any great detail. The very basics of what happened in a match are recorded team by team: Touchdowns and Casualties, Wins and Losses. There are some records for the biggest stars, but it's all very patchy and cobbled together in your terminal.

Old-era UBBL was a very amateurish affair. A little bit of learning online sees the current teams are all being run by former players. There seems to be a bit of money left over from the old-era UBBL and these owners have been trying to entice a few more of their old colleagues to join up on the field.
