# rules of the game

There are people out there who will tell you that bludbol doesn't have rules. That it's a sport of unrivalled fury and more importantly chaos. We're going to get into why that isn't true in a little bit. You've already read my assertion that it's possibly more about money coercion and unchecked aggression. 

But this is not street warfare: there are rules. And where there are rules there are enforcers of the rules. 

## the referee

I felt it was important to find an expert to talk about the rules of bludbol, but it wasn't easy. I was prepared for this though. It can be hard to track down a witness to anything in the Stacks, let alone a witness whose job it was to have an opinion on the legality of actions. There's a reason the Law Dogs team has far more revilers than revellers when they showed up to play.

> "Usually you wear white out there so the blood shows up okay when you have to do the pronouncements. It's a bit of a pain."

Malika bint Schraiaz [MBS] was a ref for the final three seasons of the BRL. She's still in the Stacks, but it took ages to track her down. Outside the pitch she tried to keep a low profile.

"You have to wear a mask when you went to a game. It wasn't a big decision for anyone except a few of the blowhards who couldn't forgive the fans for not cheering them."

Gonçalo Mendes was one of those blowhard types. He started off with the Zenser Vagabonds [ZVH] trying to be a Blitzer. He had a good streetbol reputation but the wider field for the real matches proved too much for him. He took a hit from one the big guys on the Git Fuckeders [GFO] and claimed his career was over.

"Yeah Gonçalo was the asshole I meant. I wasn't sure you knew his name." Talking to Malika felt like talking to a teacher who didn't want to answewr too many questions about the exam you were about to sit down for.

"So Gonzo starts as a ref. He does the bare minimum that refs did; put on a hood and a number and head out there to make sure too much egregious shit doesn't happen. But when I say bare minimum I mean it. Three matches in he'd stopped wearing a number and sparypainted 'Gonzo' on the back of his shirt. That was what he'd played under so everybody knew who he was. The thing is that nobody cheers for the ref. Doesn't matter if you're good or shit and Gonzo was shit. So he didn't get his rocks off even though he was on the field. So he's super unhappy and that's just a recipe for trouble."

As indeed it was. We'll come back to the sad story of Gonçalo "Gonzo" Mendes in a bit. First we need MBS to lay down the rules of the game for us.

## the ball

"A bludbol needs to be checked before every kick. You do your best to ensure that whatever the blockheads are out there playing with is roughly as big as a normal dude's head, but a bit more squished - oblong I guess. The idea is for it to be easy enough to carry with two hands and tricky in one. There was a mutie on the Tatters [CTN] I think who had an extra arm. I guess it helped."

Early in the BRL - in the Proving Grounds tournaments at least - each team brought a couple of balls of their own and the ref judged which was fair. Although this seems ripe for abuse, Malika didn't have much to say about the practice. "It was before my time."

> Need better anecdote about what was substituted for a ball

"I heard from another ref that one time one of the Kicking Mules brought in an explosive device to substitute for a ball. That would have been scary, but mostly if you were right next to it I guess. Usually that didn't happen. I think the Roadkillz [RKG] tried something like that but never in any of my matches."

Traditionally the bludbol has at least a few spikes on it. "We always provided an option when I was involved. Teams could totally go for a straight up synthetic skin, but barely any team captain would ever ask for it. The practice was that teams had to ask for the spikes. It was a joke default assumption. I think one time BC Drakonika messed up the lineup sheet and had to play unspiked. One of the biggest losses they took (and BC Drakonika [BCD] lost a lot of matches). The macho blockheads thought that the spikes would help it stick in when they were carrying it better. Or they could use it as a weapon. That never happened in my sight. I'd say that the main reason the Wyrms [OWE] do as well as they do is because they never ask for the spikes."

> Differences from Bottom Rung to StUBBL: StUBBL needs both teams to opt out of spikes.

## the field

A full-on bludbol pitch is about 130 m end to end and something like half that from side to side. They tend to be muddy, or brightly synthetically green. They're built with the crowd pressed right up to the edges.

There's a bit of a misconception about how rigged with traps these fields are. Everyone who's watched the sport has heard some blowhard next to them at the bar or in the stands talk about how they were at a match where rats had undermined the entire support structure and the teams started using the tunnels to sneak into the end zones. It's a traditional story. Sometimes it happened in the first Green Cup championship, though that's a bit too close to living memory for most of the gaffers who like to tell "I was there when..." kinds of stories. When they were kids and the only bludbol was being played between smashed transports in an alley and everyone only dreamed of being one of the Colony League stars in a ridiculously futile way.

Before the BRL began though, they did tend to play a more narrowly circumscribed version of the sport in Stacksburg, and there would be more actual obstacles on the concrete pitch. This led to a couple of weird distinctions in how bludbol developed here. A little bit more emphasis on the passing game and having receivers who could avoid the crush of a midblock bottleneck.

Pressing the fans right up to the pitch was a change they made to the BRL when they were trying to become more professional and seek the notice of the Colonial Leagues.

"It's great to be able to get a piece of the players actually in my teeth."

Is it wrong to be that close to the field? Is it dangerous? Yes, of course it is. I mean, maybe not wrong. But definitely dangerous, as the stats can bear out to some degree. Fans are made complicit in the crimes being committed on the pitch and being made part of the sport. I'll argue later about how this universalization of the Stacksburg citizenry through budbol is something social engineers might be wanting to take advantage of.

> stats on crowdsurfing and anecdote about being in the crowd needed

In general though the pitch itself tends to be well regulated. Players and fans complain about uneven surfaces at times as really this is one of the things the CBL really does have an influence over. If the infrastructure can't support a high quality of play then the league won't let Stacksburg in. This legitimacy issue will dog the BRL thorughought and is part of why I am arguing for a StUBBL approach instead.

## the duration

How long does a bludbol match take? They are remarkably quick, all things considered. The usual sequence of play is as follows:

1. Defence sets up
2. Offence sets up
3. Defence kicks
4. Offence scrambles for the ball
5. Offence attempts to break through defensive line to endzone while Defence attempts to force turnover and scramble for the ball to the opposing endzone (this is known as a Drive)
6. One of the teams succeeds at step 5 and the sequence is reset with the team that succeeded setting up as Defence.
7. The halftime whistle interrupts step 5 and the new half begins, with the original roles of Offence and Defence being switched.
8. The endgame whistle interrupts to end the match.
9. Draws are allowed, except in championship play, when there would be a sudden death scrimmage (coin flip for who gets to be offence/defence).

But what about time? How long does it take? I would say that this is where the sport is at its best and most interesting. You see, the actual placement of the halftime and endtime whistles can seem almost random. High scoring matches take longer because of all the resetting and between play chats that happen. You can have up to 9 or 10 drives in a match if the defences are utterly flailing `grab an example from the stats` but a 0-0 draw  goes much more quickly, but and this is the important part, only to the casual spectator. 

There is a subjectivity to the sport that is hard to describe to non-aficionados. Most fans walking away from a defensive masterpiece are at least a little nonplussed. "I wanted to see some touchdowns." The games are short and brutish, mostly looking like a tangle that drifted this way and that on the field leaving a bunch of moaning bodies in its wake. The actual amount of time in a high-scoring match is almost exactly the same but it feels more satisfying because there's all this time to sit and think about the passes and runs that led to a scoring play.

To players and amateur strategists though, there is so much going on in every drive, the entire thing feels much more slow and lumbering and strategic. We'll discuss strategies later but the simple creation of a cage, the building block of a ground-based drive, requires a vast number of moving parts all working in concert. Watching a match the way it is meant to be perceived requires a slowing down of perception, a fitting oneself into the rhythms of the sport rather than the patterns of normal life.

I wax faux-eloquent but it's true. There is a clock in bludbol but it is for the players, you can't let it rule you as a fan. Watch more slowly than time allows and you'll start to get a sense of the game.

If you haven't watched a match before you'll be wondering when it will all be over. It will be all too quick.

## the players

Bludbol is a sport in which the players can become very famous for their heroism/heel-nature.

### playbooks

One of the interesting features of bludbol is the variety of approaches one can take in building a roster. The flexibility - once the raw 11/16/3 numbers are satisfied (see below) - is quite immense. A team owner can assemble a bunch of players with abilities they think will help them win matches and present it to the league. This can be approved or not. Now that isn't to say that just anything will be allowed on the pitch. No one thinks fielding a lineup of 11 receivers will be as effective as a well-balanced roster, but people sometimes try. There are however a series of playbooks which are generally accepted as legitimate roster choices and styles of play in Blood Bowl. 

When a team is started up it's usual to fit the playbook to the play style you wish to run. There are playbooks that emphasize and require more skills and playbooks that emphasize require more strength. In the BRL Dorf teams tend to be built around slow durable players, and don't win a lot of matches (we'll talk about Botsford Dorf and his strategies later). The C-Dorf innovation came later and got some speed into the traidition. The Black Pearl Pirates and the Relentless Cannons were both C-Dorf teams and the Pirates especially had good success.

### rosters and lineups

For a real bludbol match you can have 11 players on the field at any given time. Per team. Rosters max out at 16 for no reason I have been able to discern, but that usually works itself out. That gives a maximum of 5 reserves to make up for injuries or special situations as the match prgresses. One of the issues with the way time is kept in bludbol though means it's possible for a team that has no hope in winning on the scoreboard to keep the match going and crushing bodies everywhere in order to literally be the last people standing. There have been a few BRL matches where a team has been bludgeoned to nothing, where everyone was knocked out at the very least. It generally doesn't last very long but it is possible. More usual is having a couple of not particularly skilled players roaming the pitch being chased by slower bruisers.

Also, a team must field as close to 11 players as they can when a drive begins. Teams like the Ogling Wyrms and the Filthy Tide both had fragile high-value players who the management will usually not want to put on the field if the game is no longer up for grabs. But if they don't have the reserves of vaguely mediocre players to fill things out it can happen that a star receiver might end up on the line of scrimmage at the beginning of a drive. This can have nasty consequences.

If a team is ever reduced by injury to having fewer than three fieldable players (the minimum necessary to start on the line of scrimmage), the team is allowed to concede the match with no further penalty (in other cases a concession leads to forfeiture of some of the gate and general bad mojo from everyone). There have been no concession matches in the BRL.

In due course we'll talk about the economics of hiring and firing bludbol players, but it's worth noting that in the salary capped environs of the BRL, players could not be paid less as their skills declined due to injury/age. This meant that slightly suboptimal players were often cycled through to bring in new players with potential but fewer skills.

### player positions

Generally a bludbol team has at the minimum, three people to stand on the line of scrimmage and take hits - the Line players. These least-skilled (and cheapest) positions can make up the entirety of almost any team regardless of playbook - High Eleven and Eleven Union teams have been known to take this approach when low on funds.

Most of the time there will be a specialist for handling the ball initially (a Thrower or Runner). If the playbook relies on passing rather than running there will be room on the roster for 2-4 Catchers.

Teams reliant on the running game will have a number of Blitzers who are generally a bit tougher and faster than your general Line player. A Blitzer is excellent on offense and defense.

There are also more defensive oriented positions such as a Blocker (usually strong slow and tough) or a more specialized Attacker (strong, fast and fragile). These positions are good at what they do and while owners would love to have whole teams of them, they're usually limited to a supporting role, so only 1-2 per team.

Some teams have petitioned for mutated enormous players to be allowed on the rosters. The union has allowed these Big Guys into the league but generally in limited capacities of 1 per team (there are a couple of exceptions, including Bludbol Club Drakonika [BDC]). In the big leagues uphive they usually keep these kinds of things out of the sport. They aren't professional enough, not serious. 

In response to that snobbery owner Lem Finkman recruited a full team of Ogres to play as the Serious Gentleman [SGO]. To fill out the rosters they involved a bunch of quasi-sentient mutants which were hucked around the field. They did manage to play a few matches though they were always treated as more of a novelty act than legitimate Bludbol. There was something offputting even to the casual bludbol fan to see these unfortunate people being used so crassly. Similar issues followed the Roadkillz [RKG], the only BRL team with a 0% winning rate.

## field crew

As bludbol professionalizes, more support staff are added to a team. In the last iteration of the BRL it was mandated that teams have the option to pay for a Medic, Assistant Coaches, and Cheerleaders. In the BRL this wasn't seen as a very big deal. Only a few teams avail themselves of extra coaches or cheerleaders (the exception being the Roadkillz [RKG] who need all the help in acquiring fans as they can get). But medics have proven to be a contentious issue.

It's generally accepted that having someone behind the scenes who can help heal your players is a very good thing. It's the humane way of going about the sport. But the CBL has mandated that the medic is only allowed to work on one player in a match. Ostensibly this is "to ensure that the player being attended to receives the utmost care from the medical staff" [bludbol official], but it's clearly a measure to keep the risk factor high and presumably the fans involved in the matches.

Players have argued that hiring more medics would be the better way to go for their protection and safety, but the CBL, BRL and a faction of the Stacksburg owners themselves argue against it. It's one of the clearest cases of the sport working against the people it relies most on.

A few teams have taken very vocal positions against the 1-medic rule and have been penalized by the CBL sanctioning body. Teams like the Carcosan Tatters [CTN], the Cursed [CUD], the Jackson Thrillers [JTN] and (somewhat surprisingly) the Law Dogs [LDN] have adopted a more self-reliant approach. This is the result of a culture focusing on drugs and returning to the match while injured. Each team relies on slightly different distribution patterns of their "health cocktails" so they still suffer a great number of injuries, but there's a chance that more of them will survive matches and seasons. They are also the only teams that have had any real success in recruiting players from other teams, though it's usually after they've suffered a debilitating, career-ending injury when the idea of some sort of long term healthcare becomes much more important.

# salaries

We'll get into the salary cap in more detail when we talk with some of the team owners but the general idea is to keep costs down for the owners. In the BRL days there was a hard payroll limit enforced at the beginning of each season. As the weeks went on and players began to earn more money, the team value could escalate, but if the owner wanted to hire any new players they had to fit below the cap. At the end of the season there was usually a wave of retirements and replacements for the next one.

Some teams are preternaturally good at keeping their payroll down and winning matches. The Carcosan Tatters [CTN] did an amazing job of this in their Green Cup II winning season. Other teams pay too much for veterans with useful skills but also drawbacks.

The one thing the players have made a part of bludbol negotiations is the impossibility of downgrading a player's pay for any reason. There are also mandated salary increases as they achieve certain milestones. This ensures that valuable players are paid something approaching what they are worth to the team.

It doesn't always happen that players are receiving kudos for their actual skills. There are a number of players who coast on fan recognition and weird out-of-sport antics to ensure they are paid better season after season.
