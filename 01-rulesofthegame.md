# rules of the game

There are people out there who will tell you that bludbol doesn't have rules. That it's a sport of unrivalled fury and more importantly chaos. We're going to get into why that isn't true in a little bit. You've already read my assertion that it's possibly more about money coercion and unchecked aggression. 

But this is not street warfare: there are rules. And where there are rules there are enforcers of the rules. 

## the referee

I felt it was important to find an expert to talk about the rules of bludbol, but it wasn't easy. I was prepared for this though. It can be hard to track down a witness to anything in the Stacks, let alone a witness whose job it was to have an opinion on the legality of actions. There's a reason the Law Dogs team has far more revilers than revellers when they showed up to play.

> "Usually you wear white out there so the blood shows up okay when you have to do the pronouncements. It's a bit of a pain."

Malika bint Schraiaz [MBS] was a ref for the final three seasons of the BRL. She's still in the Stacks, but it took ages to track her down. Outside the pitch she tried to keep a low profile.

"You have to wear a mask when you went to a game. It wasn't a big decision for anyone except a few of the blowhards who couldn't forgive the fans for not cheering them."

Gonçalo Mendes was one of those blowhard types. He started off with the Zenser Vagabonds [ZVH] trying to be a Blitzer. He had a good streetbol reputation but the wider field for the real matches proved too much for him. He took a hit from one the big guys on the Git Fuckeders [GFO] and claimed his career was over.

"Yeah Gonçalo was the asshole I meant. I wasn't sure you knew his name." Talking to Malika felt like talking to a teacher who didn't want to answewr too many questions about the exam you were about to sit down for.

"So Gonzo starts as a ref. He does the bare minimum that refs did; put on a hood and a number and head out there to make sure too much egregious shit doesn't happen. But when I say bare minimum I mean it. Three matches in he'd stopped wearing a number and sparypainted 'Gonzo' on the back of his shirt. That was what he'd played under so everybody knew who he was. The thing is that nobody cheers for the ref. Doesn't matter if you're good or shit and Gonzo was shit. So he didn't get his rocks off even though he was on the field. So he's super unhappy and that's just a recipe for trouble."

As indeed it was. We'll come back to the sad story of Gonçalo "Gonzo" Mendes in a bit. First we need MBS to lay down the rules of the game for us.

## the ball

"A bludbol needs to be checked before every kick. You do your best to ensure that whatever the blockheads are out there playing with is roughly as big as a normal dude's head, but a bit more squished - oblong I guess. The idea is for it to be easy enough to carry with two hands and tricky in one. There was a mutie on the Tatters [CTN] I think who had an extra arm. I guess it helped."

Early in the BRL - in the Proving Grounds tournaments at least - each team brought a couple of balls of their own and the ref judged which was fair. Although this seems ripe for abuse, Malika didn't have much to say about the practice. "It was before my time."

> Need better anecdote about what was substituted for a ball

"I heard from another ref that one time one of the Kicking Mules brought in an explosive dvice to substitute for a ball. That would have been scary, but mostly if you were right next to it I guess. Usually that didn't happen. I think the Roadkillz [RKG] tried something like that but never in any of my matches."

Traditionally the bludbol has at least a few spikes on it. "We always provided an option when I was involved. Teams could totally go for a straight up synthetic skin, but barely any team captain would ever ask for it. The practice was that teams had to ask for the spikes. It was a joke default assumption. I think one time BC Drakonika messed up the lineup sheet and had to play unspiked. One of the biggest losses they took (and BC Drakonika [BCD]lost a lot of matches). The macho blockheads thought that the spikes would help it stick in when they were carrying it better. Or they could use it as a weapon. That never happened in my sight. I'd say that the main reason the Wyrms [OWE] do as well as they do is because they never ask for the spikes."

> Differences from Bottom Rung to StUBBL: StUBBL needs both teams to opt out of spikes.

## the field

A full-on bludbol pitch is about 130 m end to end and something like half that from side to side. They tend to be muddy, or brightly synthetically green. They're built with the crowd pressed right up to the edges.
