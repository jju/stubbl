Hey there BludBol fans and welcome to the [SpreadZone](index), your source for all the doings in the UBBL coming up on the eleventh Green Cup season.

 

From [previously in the spreadZone](gcxi-picks): 

Here's how we think the season is going to shake out:

| Burger Conference | | Classic Conference | |
|---------------------|--|------------|----|
| *Stacks* | *Outlands* | *Heaps* | *Pits* |
| Old Wyrms | Badger Claws | Orbital Machine | Ravenous Eagles |
| Filthy Tide | Irregular Cogs | Glorious Hounds | Eldritch Fatality |
| Gore Farmers | Arboreal Menace | Kaiju Dynamo | Cackling Furies |
| TC Sump Runners | Carcosan Tatters | Zensun Vagabonds | Darkling Spectres |
