# spreadZone - GCXI Badger Claws

Hey there BludBol fans and welcome to the [SpreadZone](spreadzone/index.md), your source for all the doings in the UBBL coming up on the eleventh Green Cup season.

One of the biggest stories this season is the fate of [Aeson](../players/aeson). The legendary catcher for the [Badger Claws](../teams/badgerclaws) doesn't really have a lot to prove in the UBBL, so it doesn't really make a lot of sense for the team to be pouring resources into those (practically guaranteed) TDs Aeson collects.

The problem for team management is that the players' union finally got pay bumps negotiated. Through GCX, players were compensated at a standard rate depending solely on their on-field performance. The argument was that teams didn't pay them less when they got injured (as usually happens in BludBol) so this was fair to everyone. The GCIX payroll shenanigans put the lie to this and showed that management was not doing their part in maintaining the health of their players, mostly in order to keep their value as low as possible. (For some teams this was explained as maintaining onfield competitive advantage but for others it was clearly meant to take in as many resources as possible.)

Now players are able to negotiate bonuses based on their service time and for awards of excellence. These aren't huge in and of themselves, but in the case of a dominant force like Aeson it actually brought his salary up near the tops of the league, befitting his stats (and remarkable avoidance of injury). But with Aeson commanding more compensation, it starts to look a little better for the team to be developing alternative methods to try and win games (especially given their lack of Green Cup playoff success).

To that end, the rookie [[Rong]] has been signed for the GCXI season. This actually took a bit of financial finagling for the team which took advantage of the other major offseason development in the ability for players to sign with other teams (which compensates both the players and their former teams). The Claws sold [Donat](donat.md) to the Open Division [Vanadium Hunters](../teams/vanadiumhunters) for the second Orange Goblet tournament. Donat had been injured before the new medical regimes were instituted and was being kept on the Claws' payroll as a less-reliable backup to Aeson. Donat's career ended in his first match for the Hunters, but the Claws had already been paid and could now afford to develop a rookie.

Word from the team makes it sound like Aeson will have a limited role this season until the playoff eligibility begins in Week 11, giving [[Rong]] and the rest of the team some time to develop a nonAeson-specific way to win matches. We're sure he's still aiming to achieve 150 pro-level TDs before retiring, and if the team looks to be stumbling badly he might be brought in to get more points earlier.

The Claws are definitely a team to watch this season.
