Hey there BludBol fans and welcome to the [SpreadZone](spreadzone/index.md), your source for all the doings in the UBBL coming up on the eleventh Green Cup season.

It's unclear exactly why fans of the [Orbital Machine](../teams/orbitalmachine) are so down on their team going into the eleventh Green Cup. They have solid players but not a lot of funding, so they're taking the (somewhat dubious) approach of sitting their best player to start the season in the hopes they can weather the storm early and build up a reserve for injuries later.

From [previously in the spreadZone](gcxi-picks): 

Here's how we think the season is going to shake out:

| Burger Conference | | Classic Conference | |
|---------------------|--|------------|----|
| *Stacks* | *Outlands* | *Heaps* | *Pits* |
| Old Wyrms | Badger Claws | Orbital Machine | Ravenous Eagles |
| Filthy Tide | Irregular Cogs | Glorious Hounds | Eldritch Fatality |
| Gore Farmers | Arboreal Menace | Kaiju Dynamo | Cackling Furies |
| TC Sump Runners | Carcosan Tatters | Zensun Vagabonds | Darkling Spectres |
