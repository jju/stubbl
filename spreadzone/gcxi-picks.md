# spreadZone - GCXI Picks

Hey there BludBol fans and welcome to the [SpreadZone](spreadzone/index.md), your source for all the doings in the UBBL coming up on the eleventh Green Cup season.

With the preseason training camps coming to a close and rosters being finalized for GCXI, let's take a look at the divisions.

In the Stacks the [Old Wyrms](../teams/oldwyrms) are defending champions, with massive skills and a monster payroll going for the three-peat while the [Filthy Tide](../teams/filthytide) are hoping their phenom scorer can keep on moving in her sophomore season and get the Tide some playoff wins. The [Gore Farmers](../teams/gorefarmers) are (surprisingly with their history) putting together a very competitive team, but we here at SZ don't see them making a huge run in the regular season, not with the [TyrolCorp Sump Runners](../teams/sumprunners) occupying the bottom rung of the division and not seeming to be making any big adjustments.

The Outlands division looks way more competitive for GCXI. The [Badger Claws](../teams/badgerclaws) still have the biggest star in the game but [Aeson](../players/aeson) has mentioned this might be his final season, so player development looks like an imperative at least early in the season. The [Irregular Cogs](../teams/irregularcogs) have the personnel to be really good, but they've been stumbling recently come playoff time so there are some arguments against going all in for the regular season. That said, the [Arboreal Menace](../teams/arborealmenace) are poised to fight for their first shot at Green Cup playoffs though that will require bettering the defensive powerhouse [Carcosan Tatters](../teams/carcosantatters).

The Heaps division had some of the biggest surprises last season, including a terrible [Glorious Hounds](../teams/glorioushounds) team. They seem to have shaken that off and winning UBBL Challenge IV in the mean time has given them a lot more confidence. The [Orbital Machine](../teams/orbitalmachine) has been shedding fans after the last season but our projections have them playing respectable bashy BludBol. The [Kaiju Dynamo](../teams/kaijudynamo) outperformed their expectations in GCX, but the same can be said about the [Zensun Vagabonds](../teams/zensunvagabonds). Which of those teams can play up to this season's hopes? Only the next 15 matches will tell.

Then of course we have the Pits. This is the division where we've got two rebuilding teams in the [Eldritch Fatality](..teams/eldritchfatality) and the [Cackling Furies](..teams/cacklingfuries). The Fatality were lousy in GCX, surprising everyone and they don't have the funds so far to fund a big new push. The [Darkling Spectres](../teams/darklingspectres) are running out a strange new lineup for them, which a lot of people have a hard time envisioning as a successful one. All this ineptitude probably leaves the division ripe for the [Ravenous Eagles](../teams/ravenouseagles) to sneak through to the division title again, but it's hard to say.

So here's how we think the regular season is going to shake out:

| Burger Conference | | Classic Conference | |
|---------------------|--|------------|----|
| *Stacks* | *Outlands* | *Heaps* | *Pits* |
| Old Wyrms | Badger Claws | Orbital Machine | Ravenous Eagles |
| Filthy Tide | Irregular Cogs | Glorious Hounds | Eldritch Fatality |
| Gore Farmers | Arboreal Menace | Kaiju Dynamo | Cackling Furies |
| TC Sump Runners | Carcosan Tatters | Zensun Vagabonds | Darkling Spectres |

There is an alternative projection technique that you might also be interested in where some of these races play out quite differently:

| Burger Conference | | Classic Conference | |
|---------------------|--|------------|----|
| *Stacks* | *Outlands* | *Heaps* | *Pits* |
| Old Wyrms | Arboreal Menace | Glorious Hounds | Eldritch Fatality |
| Filthy Tide | Irregular Cogs | Kaiju Dynamo | Cackling Furies |
| Gore Farmers | Badger Claws | Zensun Vagabonds | Ravenous Eagles |
| TC Sump Runners | Carcosan Tatters | Orbital Machine | Darkling Spectres |

This system never really trusts in defensively-oriented teams, so bear that in mind as you look at the Outlands.
