Hey there BludBol fans and welcome to the [SpreadZone](spreadzone/index.md), your source for all the doings in the UBBL coming up on the eleventh Green Cup season.

The [Old Wyrms](../teams/oldwyrms) are defending champions this season, much like they were at the beginning of GCX, but the expectations this go-round are much higher (well, not higher exactly, just more pressurized). 

Individually, we see [[elvis]] as the player with the most immediate personal goals. He's only 15 completions away from [[yosif]]'s Green Cup record which could be handled before the middle of this season, though the actual distance covered by those passes will require a lot more time to acquire. Once that completions milestone is acheived, might we see [[Jia]] shouldering more of the ball distribution, or even getting a rookie in the mix. 

After the resource bonus for winning GCX, the Wyrms have a very deep bench, which they may need if the rest of the Green Cup teams come out looking for blood. They open their season against three bashy teams (the [Cackling Furies](../teams/cacklingfuries), the [Gore Farmers](../teams/gorefarmers) and the [Orbital Machine](../teams/orbitalmachine)) which could remove some of their early options. That said, the Wyrms got through GCX's regular season despite a slow start, so they probably aren't too worried about an early sag as long as it isn't the [Filthy Tide](../teams/filthytide) gaining all the ground. They'll be closing out their season against much less physically dangerous teams so they should be able to have a healthy playoff run.

From [previously in the spreadZone](gcxi-picks): 

Here's how we think the season is going to shake out:

| Burger Conference | | Classic Conference | |
|---------------------|--|------------|----|
| *Stacks* | *Outlands* | *Heaps* | *Pits* |
| Old Wyrms | Badger Claws | Orbital Machine | Ravenous Eagles |
| Filthy Tide | Irregular Cogs | Glorious Hounds | Eldritch Fatality |
| Gore Farmers | Arboreal Menace | Kaiju Dynamo | Cackling Furies |
| TC Sump Runners | Carcosan Tatters | Zensun Vagabonds | Darkling Spectres |
