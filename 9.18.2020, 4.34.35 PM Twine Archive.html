You should cheer for the Gore Farmers!

When the Gore Farmers are good they can be very good, as evidenced by their two Green Cup wins in the modern era. But they can also be really bad, which has led to relegation and terrible seasons and an overall record hovering around .500.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 41-15-44

The Option-Crush approach to BludBol is traditional, simple, but also somewhat arcane. A team can use 4 strong slow and unskilled linemen, 4 faster attacking blitzers, 2 dedicated ball-handlers, 4 weak slow receivers and a nigh-unlimited supply of tough fodder. The basic idea is to get a ball handler into a cage and grind out a 2-1 win, but there are more options for the team that wishes to develop them. The Gore Farmers, for instance, *mostly* eschew the Big Guy approach.

The Gore Farmers and the [[Orbital Machine-&gt;orbitalmachine]] both won the sixth Green Cup (one Classic and one not) and that dispute over which one should really count fuelled their rivalry. The [[Darkling Spectres-&gt;darklingspectres]] at this point are the team the Farmers try their best to fend off, as successfully as they have thus far.

You should be a fan of the Old Wyrms!

Even when they&#39;re bad they aren&#39;t that bad. And when they&#39;re good they&#39;re dazzling. They are the UBBL&#39;s only three-time champions and the only team to have defended a championship.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 61-19-36

The Wyrms use what&#39;s known as the Excelsior playbook, where a fast fragile receiving corps works together downfield making catches in traffic and getting out of trouble. It&#39;s a shorter-passing game than the High Extension playbook used by the [[Glorious Hounds-&gt;glorioushounds]] but when you can avoid injury it&#39;s very effective, as the Wyrms have shown.

As the winningest team in the UBBL, Wyrm fans can be among the most despised. From their end, however, the main rivalries are with the [[Zensun Vagabonds-&gt;zensunvagabonds]] as the two &quot;Founders&quot; of the UBBL, the [[Irregular Cogs-&gt;irregularcogs]] (mostly for historical reasons), and the [[Gore Farmers-&gt;gorefarmers]], who have won more Green Cups in the modern era (and share the Stacks division with them).

You should be a fan of the Filthy Tide!

The Filthy Tide are often called the best team to never win the Green Cup. They&#39;re an Original 8 team that has had two of the best scorers for their eras in the UBBL but has never been able to convert the big win to get their stars a championship. Now they are in rebuild mode.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 49-12-52

The Filthy Tide uses the Scrying Avian playbook which emphasizes speed above all else, especially the health of your own players. With proper training it&#39;s possible to have a super-fast scorer, which makes the lack of defensive ability easier to overcome.

The Filthy Tide have long been in the shadow of the [[Old Wyrms-&gt;oldwyrms]]. They have had great individual players but no team success. Tide fans see Wyrms supporters as arrogant blowhards, but they hate Wyrms management even more for their unsentimental business first approach to winning. Tide fans also see the [[Badger Claws-&gt;badgerclaws]] as an up and coming rival, and would love to see their star, Aeson, retire, preferably without a Green Cup ring.

You should cheer for the Sump Runners!

They were once thought to be the future of BludBol in the old era UBBL, and were set to play in Green Cup V before the interruption. They&#39;ve never lived up to that, though they are good in Open Division play. They lean more on the passing game than most generalist teams do, which can make them more fun to watch than other teams with a similar playbook.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 16-12-28

The Sump Runners use the Hermann playbook, the original plan for playing BludBol, and the one that every other strategy is an adaptation of. The team has two thrower positions available, 4 catchers, 4 blitzers, a big guy and fills out the rest of the lineup with undistinguished concussion-fodder. The Sump Runners go with have some oddities in their lineup including using a specialist thrower as a makeshift blitzer.

In the past the [[Vanadium Hunters-&gt;vanadiumhunters]] were the Sump Runners&#39; chief rivals, but with them relegated it&#39;s slim pickings. They had a devastating loss to the [[Arborists-&gt;arborists]] in the third UBBL Challenge tournament, which may spark something moving on.

You should cheer for the Carcosan Tatters!

The Carcosan Tatters have always been a very good team. They&#39;re defensive-minded without really flashy stars and can lock a game down to a muddy slog even if the sun is out.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 52-14-35

The Tatters use the Nergal playbook, some (especially fans of pretty BludBol) say it is one of the oldest and most insidious ways to play. The lineup consists of four strong blockers, four blitzing ball handlers and whatever dregs of fodder can be pulled off the street or opposing teams. Their biggest strengths are making everything difficult for the opposition.

The Tatters&#39; main rivals are the [[Orbital Machine-&gt;orbitalmachine]]. They have a similar defensive playbook, but that&#39;s the main basis for any animosity. Fans of the Tatters, like the players on the Tatters, don&#39;t really care much for what other teams do. Aesthetically, they are near diametric opposites of the [[Glorious Hounds-&gt;glorioushounds]] who prefer to make everything graceful and easy looking.

You should be a fan of the Arborists!

The Arborists are the newest entries for the Green Cup competition, having won the third UBBL Challenge for their shot. They are passers and speedsters and are part of the slow wave of skillifying Pro-Level UBBL.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 0-0-0

The Arborists use the Wary Eagle playbook, which is very similar to the Scrying Avian technique, but with slightly higher skilled (and more expensive to replace) players. The lineup includes four catchers, two blitzers and throwers that have more of an option of holding back and letting fly once the catchers are in position.

As the Arborists are in their first Pro-Level season they don&#39;t have a lot of long-standing rivalries. Among Open-Level teams they bumped heads most with Thorns fans. Coming into GCX though, their natural rivals are the [[Badger Claws-&gt;badgerclaws]] as the other upstart team in the race to be the first of them to win the coveted Cup.

--
You should be a fan of the Badger Claws!

The Badger Claws fought their way into Green Cup play from the Open Division and have never had a season below .500. They also, as of Green Cup X, have the greatest scorer in UBBL history playing for them.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 20-5-12

The Badger Claws use the Scrying Avian playbook which emphasizes speed above all else, especially the health of your own players. With proper training it&#39;s possible to have a super-fast scorer onside, which makes the lack of defensive ability easier to overcome.

The team has a few rivalries going to sustain it. The [[Arborists-&gt;arborists]] are a natural rival as the new upstart little sibling in the Green Cup world, while their use of the same playbook as the [[Filthy Tide-&gt;filthytide]] make for some natural &quot;Who did it better?&quot; kinds of comparisons. Then there&#39;s the [[Kaiju Dynamo-&gt;kaijudynamo]] a team that almost no one takes seriously, but the Claws have consistently had to get through in their playoff runs.

You should be a fan of the Irregular Cogs!

The team of history that has never managed to re-live up to it. The Irregular Cogs won the inaugural Green Cup against their archrivals the [[Old Wyrms-&gt;oldwyrms]]. Then came a long period of good play but few results.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 59-11-43

The Irregular Cogs use the Drop Eagle playbook. It&#39;s an adaptation of the Hermann playbook that again requires more skilled players to run it effectively. The strategy dispenses with the catcher position entirely, instead using four skilled blitzers to run the ball, and two dedicated ball-hawks to attack the opposing ball-carriers. It&#39;s an aggressive defense that does as much work as their offense.

The Cogs and the [[Old Wyrms-&gt;oldwyrms]] are traditional rivals, and the fact the Cogs won the first Green Cup is the bright point for the Cogs in that history. More recently, the [[Orbital Machine-&gt;orbitalmachine]] made the Cogs&#39; shit list in &quot;the Battle of Dungardin&quot; and they&#39;re always looking over their shoulders at the [[Eldritch Fatality-&gt;eldritchfatality]] who use the same playbook.

You should cheer for the Zensun Vagabonds!

Usually credited along with the Old Wyrms as the founders of the UBBL, the Vagabonds have a long history of not being great. Which is kind of funny as they did almost win the Green Cup once back in the Old-Era.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 38-23-47

The Vagabonds use the Hermann playbook, the original plan for playing BludBol, and the one that every other strategy is an adaptation of. The team has two thrower positions available, 4 catchers, 4 blitzers, a big guy and fills out the rest of the lineup with undistinguished concussion-fodder. Like most Hermann teams, the Vagabonds don&#39;t use all their specialist receivers, trusting more to a running game with the blitzers.

The Vagabonds&#39; primary rivalry is with the [[Old Wyrms-&gt;oldwyrms]] as the pair of UBBL Founders. They&#39;ve never been nearly as good as the Wyrms, so a lot of fans see themselves as custodians of tradition instead of victory.

You should cheer for the Orbital Machine!

A dominant bashing Modern-Era team, the Orbital Machine embodies a team-oriented approach. They inflict a lot of casualties and have the best winning streak in the UBBL (12 wins spanning two seasons).

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 32-7-20

The Orbital Machine uses the Chariot playbook. This involves four massive players on the line with everyone else more lightly armoured but able to blitz like no one&#39;s business. Passing and ball-handling tend to be a secondary consideration and get focused into whichever players show an aptitude while the rest of the team assembles the cage to roll down the field.

Fans of the Machine don&#39;t get on especially well with the other main bashing teams in the Pros (the [[Carcosan Tatters-&gt;carcosantatters]] and [[Gore Farmers-&gt;gorefarmers]]). Adding to the frisson with the Farmers is the disputed nature of the &quot;true winner&quot; of the sixth Green Cup.

You should be a fan of the Kaiju Dynamo!

The Kaiju Dynamo are a frustrating team to cheer for. They always seem right on the cusp of being really good, then it all falls apart, leaving them as almost exactly a .500 team. Being a Dynamo fan means one is long-suffering.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 45-15-44

The Dynamo use the Elizabeth Aardman playbook, with strong linemen and a big guy anchoring the centre, while the ball handlers are chosen for speed (rather than skill, strength or durability). The basic idea of the playbook is to cage the fragile ballhandler to a place where they can bolt for the endzone.

No one becomes a fan of the Dynamo because they enjoy the easy life. There are always injuries to someone critical to the offense, and training up rookies to take the place of linemen that have cycled out of the lineup means every season has more &quot;developmental&quot; games than a fan who wants quick victory will enjoy.

Dynamo fans have been burned in the past by Scrying Avian teams (so the [[Badger Claws-&gt;badgerclaws]] and [[Filthy Tide-&gt;filthytide]]) and the disparity between their record and number of championships compared to the [[Gore Farmers-&gt;gorefarmers]] always rankles.

You should be a fan of the Glorious Hounds!

The Hounds are all about deep passes to wide open receivers and how that is &quot;the only true way&quot; to play BludBol. They have never quite lived up to their own hype, but it is impossible to deny the prettiness of their game.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 39-9-32

The Glorious Hounds use the High Extension playbook, a venerable adaptation of the Hermann technique. Generally to play this style, you need a higher skill level. The playbook uses four receivers but only two blitzers and no big guy option. The idea is usually for the thrower to hang onto the ball longer than in the Excelsior or Drop Eagle playbooks giving the catchers time to get open downfield.

Hounds fans generally despise teams that aren&#39;t trying to play aesthetically beautiful BludBol, so the [[Ravenous Eagles-&gt;ravenouseagles]] and [[Carcosan Tatters-&gt;carcosantatters]] are the most common targets of their ire.

The Ravenous Eagles are often referred to as the Worst Green Cup Champions, which is all right with the Ossa ownership group as they flaunt their rings.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 25-7-34

The Eagles use the Charles Dorf playbook, which is built on a very rigid division of smash and grab labour. They use slow tacklers on the line to block off the centre, three strong blitzers and a fragile ball-handling corps (which is a faster group than the blockers, but comparatively slow across the league).

Fans of the Ravenous Eagles glory in their championship titles and especially love getting in the faces of fans of the [[Glorious Hounds-&gt;glorioushounds]].

You should cheer for the Darkling Spectres!

While of late the Darkling Spectres have been mired in mediocrity, they can be an effective defensive team. Their ownership sees the team as primarily a profit centre since on-field results have been hard to come by recently.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 34-12-38

The Spectres use the traditional Unglewort playbook. They have nigh-unlimited cheap slow fodder for the line that funnel opposition towards the reliable massive blockers. Two blitzers attack opposing ball-carriers, and up to four ball-carriers supply all of the speed, though they are very fragile.

The Spectres have come close to winning the Green Cup a couple of times, but have been thwarted by similarily bashing teams. Fans hate it when the schedule comes up against the [[Orbital Machine-&gt;orbitalmachine]] or the [[Gore Farmers-&gt;gorefarmers]].

You should cheer for the Cackling Furies!

The Cackling Furies are an Old-Era expansion team that can cause a lot of injuries, but will take a lot in exchange.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 33-19-39

The Furies use the Norton playbook, which is mostly a way to get less skilled players to channel their energy into flinging themselves at the opposition in a terrible frenzy. The use a couple of strong ball-hawks, some blitzers, even receivers, but all one sees when a team is going Norton is whirling masses of limbs and teeth. To do this they can&#39;t protect themselves very well, so there is a lot of roster turnover.

Cackling Furies fans don&#39;t have a lot of rivalries, getting in everyone&#39;s faces about evenly. They do, however, dislike the [[Old Wyrms-&gt;oldwyrms]] quite vehemently. The Furies&#39; style of play can make them quite dangerous to the (fragile) Wyrms as well.

You should be a fan of the Eldritch Fatality!

A youngish team, they weren&#39;t active in the Green Cup before the Interruption, but have come along as fierce competitors in the Modern Era, never having worse than a 60% win rate.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 36-8-19

The Eldritch Fatality use the Drop Eagle playbook. It&#39;s an adaptation of the Hermann playbook that again requires more skilled players to run it effectively. The strategy dispenses with the catcher position entirely, instead using four skilled blitzers to run the ball, and two dedicated ball-hawks to attack the opposing ball-carriers. It&#39;s an aggressive defense that does as much work as their offense.

The Fatality have a bit of a chip on their shoulder. They are a really good team that wins wins wins, but then they can&#39;t quite get the championship into their house. The [[Orbital Machine-&gt;orbitalmachine]] and [[Old Wyrms-&gt;oldwyrms]] have both beaten them on their paths to a Green Cup, and the mere fact that such an &quot;objectively lousy&quot; team like the [[Ravenous Eagles-&gt;ravenouseagles]] has won a Cup before them rankles badly. But the lack of Cup success is only a part of using the same playbook as the [[Irregular Cogs-&gt;irregularcogs]] which they are perpetually overshadowed by even though they are the better team these days.

You should cheer for the Gargantuan Brutes!

The Brutes have folded because they could not maintain the 33% Winning Rate required to maintain status in the UBBL. They were once a feared casualty-inflicting powerhouse, but now there is only nostalgia.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 10-10-42

The Brutes have folded and the fans mostly don their old blue jerseys ironically these days. Many transferred their allegiances to the [[Ravenous Eagles-&gt;ravenouseagles]], or the Open-Level [[Mules-&gt;mules]].

You should cheer for the Vanadium Hunters!

The Hunters have never managed to achieve a winning season. They are generally a bad team, but they did achieve a Doom Fist in the old-era UBBL. Currently they have been relegated to the Open Division.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 19-15-37

The Hunters use the Hermann playbook, the original plan for playing BludBol, and the one that every other strategy is an adaptation of. The team has two thrower positions available, 4 catchers, 4 blitzers, a big guy and fills out the rest of the lineup with undistinguished concussion-fodder. Like most Hermann teams, the Hunters don&#39;t use all their specialist receivers, trusting more to a running game with the blitzers.

The Hunters have been around a long time and in the Old-Era had one of the best players in the business. Their fans love their traditional style and get really angry at teams like the [[Kaiju Dynamo-&gt;kaijudynamo]] who try new-fangled approaches to the game.

After the mass elevator was finally installed a relative peace came to Stacksburg. It was an enforced peace to be sure, one bought and paid for with up-hive money, but the millions of residents of this little section of underhive weren&#39;t getting killed quickly in hails of gunfire any more. This was better.

In this new peace there came sport. BludBol took hold of kids&#39; imaginations the way gangsterism used to. In Stacksburg teams were organized and the Underhive BludBol League was formed. The prize? A Green Cup.

We&#39;re three hundred megaseconds into the UBBL experiment now, and you endured the long off-season for the tenth Green Cup season (GCX for short) is about to begin. It&#39;s time to cheer on your team, come what may in this sure to be eventful season. It&#39;s not like you have any way of influencing events as a fan, right?

So first things first. Who is your team? What colours do you bleed?

All right, here we are. Projections.

| Stacks | Outlands | Heaps | Pits |
|------------|----|------------|----|
| Old Wyrms | Badger Claws | Glorious Hounds | Eldritch Fatality |
| Filthy Tide | Irregular Cogs | Kaiju Dynamo | Ravenous Eagles |
| Gore Farmers | Arborists | Orbital Machine | Cackling Furies |
| TC Sump Runners | Carcosan Tatters | Zensun Vagabonds | Darkling Spectres |

Here are the first week&#39;s matches.

* Filthy Tide - Kaiju Dynamo
* Badger Claws - Zensun Vagabonds
* Ravenous Eagles - Orbital Machine
* TC Sump Runners - Arborists
* Glorious Hounds - Darkling Spectres
* Eldritch Fatality - Carcosan Tatters
* Old Wyrms - Cackling Furies
* Irregular Cogs - Gore Farmers

The Sump Runners vs the Arborists is an immediate rematch of the UBBL Challenge III title bout. The Arborists drubbed the Runners last time which qualified them for this Green Cup season. The Runners don&#39;t have a good replacement lineup ready.

We&#39;ll also be interested in the Filthy Tide vs Kaiju Dynamo to see if Venus can be the player she was groomed to be and if Sabah still has enough left in the tank to lead this Dynamo team.

Okay. Good luck.

Sabah did his job, as far the Dynamo were concerned, but they just couldn&#39;t handle the offensive pressure from the Tide.

Week Two schedule:

* Cackling Furies - Darkling Spectres
* Eldritch Fatality - Ravenous Eagles 
* Filthy Tide - Carcosan Tatters 
* Old Wyrms - Badger Claws 
* Gore Farmers - Arborists 
* Irregular Cogs - Zensun Vagabonds 
* Kaiju Dynamo - Orbital Machine 
* Glorious Hounds - TC Sump Runners

After a week with a lot of draws, the teams that did get wins are looking to open up some gaps. We&#39;re watching the Arborists&#39; match against the Gore Farmers to see if they can hang onto their standings lead when faced with a former Green Cup champion. The Old Wyrms and the Badger Claws could be a high scoring affair, and a real test of how the Claws perform when they can&#39;t lean on Aeson for scoring. And for those who like nostalgia, one of those Original 8 matchups is happening in the Vagabonds vs. the Cogs.

Week Three schedule:

* Cackling Furies - Eldritch Fatality
* Carcosan Tatters - Glorious Hounds 
* Filthy Tide - Zensun Vagabonds 
* Orbital Machine - Badger Claws 
* Gore Farmers - Old Wyrms 
* Arborists - Ravenous Eagles  
* Kaiju Dynamo - Irregular Cogs
* Darkling Spectres - TC Sump Runners

The Arborists have kept their winning going, so now we&#39;re definitely watching their matchup with the Eagles with great interest.  It will also be good to see if the Badger Claws can bounce back from a tough week previous, and a Farmers-Wyrms matchup of the multiple champions is often entertaining.

This week saw the scoring race really heat up with a new three-way tie for first place between Atte (EF), Sabah (KD) and Aeson (BC) at 7 TDs apiece with Costache (GH) right behind at 6. Player of the Week was the young Venus (FT) with 14 SPP.

Everyone in the Outlands lost this week, leaving their standings unchanged and really close, while in the Pits, the bottom teams got within a win of the top. The big losers as far as the standings go were the Filthy Tide who are a full win out of third place in the Stacks.

Week Six schedule:

* Badger Claws - Carcosan Tatters
* Filthy Tide - Old Wyrms
* Eldritch Fatality - Irregular Cogs
* TC Sump Runners - Gore Farmers  
* Glorious Hounds - Kaiju Dynamo
* Zensun Vagabonds - Darkling Spectres
* Orbital Machine - Arborists
* Ravenous Eagles - Cackling Furies

This week is one that has a lot of good storylines. The Arborists try to regroup and win against bashing after a couple of speedy opponents. The Filthy Tide and the Old Wyrms have an important divisional match that could keep everything knotted up or really open up the Stacks. The Cogs and the Fatality are both in their divisional basements and now have to claw at each other using the same playbook. And the Vagabonds-Spectres match might be an interesting case of under-regarded second-place teams having an exciting match.

Summary and PoW

[if fanOf === &#39;Arborists&#39;]
A win for either would have put them on top of their divisions, but the draw leaves the Machine and Arborists in the middle of the fray. It looks like the Arborists do better against bashing teams so far.  OM 2 - AR 2
[continue]
[if fanOf === &#39;Badger Claws&#39;]
Battling for tops in the Outlands and the entire league. The Claws received the kick and Aeson scored, then the Tatters drew out the rest of the half to score, but most of their injuries were only minor and the Badger Claws&#39; medical staff got everyone back out on the field to start the second half. The Tatters managed to play the long game, and scored as late as possible to take the lead, putting all the pressure on Aeson to tie up the match in the dying seconds. Aeson succumbed to the pressure and made a rare stumble and the Tatters won. BC 1 - CT 2
[continue]
[if fanOf === &#39;Cackling Furies&#39;]
The fight for first in the Pits was won in the first half when the Eagles&#39; defense swallowed up the Furies attack. After that it was mostly just a case of defending until Humbert could make a timely endzone run. (There were a few palpitations before that, but we always gloss over a bit.) RE 2 - CF 1

[continue]
[if fanOf === &#39;Darkling Spectres&#39;]
The Spectres and Vagabonds traded TDs throughout and it came down to a matter of possession timing that put the Vagabonds on top in one of their best matches in recent memory. The Vagabonds are having their best offensive season ever with a TD/GP rate over pi. ZV 5 - DS 4 
[continue]
[if fanOf === &#39;Eldritch Fatality&#39;]
With two Drop Eagle playbooks clashing from the bottom of their divisions this one turned out to be a decent rivalry match. The Cogs defense scored twice in the first half, showing the Fatality how to Drop Eagle. The opening drive of the second got the Fatality a TD from their defense, but then the Cogs just got in the passing lanes and won. (Atte didn&#39;t score, leaving her watching the Badger Claws match closely.) EF 1 - IC 4 
[continue]
[if fanOf === &#39;Filthy Tide&#39;]
Going into this match the Tide didn&#39;t have the money to hide Venus when the defense took the field. The first half went for the Tide, giving them a 2-2 draw going into the second, but then a perfect defensive read stopped Venus from traipsing down the sidelines and on the ensuing kick Aleksy fumbled the pickup, giving the Wyrms a 2-TD lead after they broke Venus&#39; leg (she should be okay). Just a gut-punch of a match for the Filthy faithful, and a real boost for the Wyrms. Also of note, a Sump Runner win starts to leave the Tide out of the playoff picture entirely (UPDATE: the Sump Runners lost). FT 3 - OW 4
[continue]
[if fanOf === &#39;Glorious Hounds&#39;]
Sabah, star of the Dynamo, the lynchpin of their offense, was taken out by a blitz before the ball hit the ground, but they managed to bring a 2-0 lead into halftime. By midway through the second half the Hounds were reduced to a 5-player lineup. The final score does not indicate what a laugher this one was, but if this is a playoff matchup the Dynamo might not get so lucky. GH 2 - KD 3
[continue]
[if fanOf === &#39;Gore Farmers&#39;]
The Sump Runners went into this match without their muscle, hoping to play a finesse game against their intradivisional rival. The Farmers bashed the Runners down to a lineup of 6 players through the first half, but couldn&#39;t score. The Farmers then dominated the second half with enough time to practice some cute passing tricks around Shay and got their win. SR 0 - GF 1

If you&#39;re feeling about the same about your team that&#39;s cool, but you could get [[more invested-&gt;investmentPlus]] in their success/failure if you want, [[or less-&gt;investmentMinus]] if the lure of sports is affecting your life more than you would prefer.

Week Seven schedule:

* Glorious Hounds - Badger Claws
* Old Wyrms - Orbital Machine
* Eldritch Fatality - Zensun Vagabonds
* TC Sump Runners - Ravenous Eagles  
* Kaiju Dynamo - Darkling Spectres
* Irregular Cogs - Arborists
* Filthy Tide - Cackling Furies
* Gore Farmers - Carcosan Tatters

A less exciting week than number six, but we do get to see the league&#39;s 2 top teams duke it out in the Gore Farmers vs Carcosan Tatters. The Cogs Arborists game has a good chance of being rematched in the playoffs, so it should be a good test of the Arborist skill against a skillful team. Otherwise, the Heaps are the division with a lot of pressure attached to their matches. Whoever loses will start having to play catchup as the season progresses. Atte Aeson and Sabah are all ready to resume hostilities in the TD race, with Aeson having the easiest path to the endzone.

# before

The gunfire had gone sporadic. More squealing and the buzz of the in-your-face weapons dominated. That&#39;s the time for you to break cover and start putting together the story. Now everyone involved was either hacking and slashing or keeping an eye out for who&#39;d make it out unscathed. Well, minimally scathed. It&#39;s hard to walk away from a knife-fight without a few of your fluids escaping.

But there you go again, making yourself sound tough. It&#39;s an important part of life in the Stacks, but you don&#39;t have to like it. You don&#39;t actually have to do it either. You&#39;re Kayro Jane and you&#39;re a fucking professional.

And so you do the duckwalk low behind one of the barricades, ridiculous hivis orange hat bucketed atop your skull. It&#39;s easier than a flag, and people know you by it. They know you&#39;re working when it&#39;s on. If the gangbangers ever catch on and start wearing them too, you&#39;re going to be fucked. Well, shot more likely. Probably by some kid in goggles.

This fight didn&#39;t need to happen though, and the sound of the yelling sounds more like posturing than any real anger anymore. The brutes and the rats came down because of a rumour, words that one of the elevator teams lost some of their gear. You might as well start the exit plan. The loot was probably a lie, and even if it&#39;s not, Brom&#39;s assholes didn&#39;t need the scrap they&#39;d make from selling it, and it&#39;s hard to overestimate the rats abilities to actually use anything they might find.

But that&#39;s the problem. You&#39;re doing it again, the thinking you know how it works down here. People scrabbling in the dark for scraps and offcuts. And thinking without looking, without seeing, is how you get a knife pressed to your kidney.

&quot;I&#39;m noncombat,&quot; you say. Your hands don&#39;t move. It&#39;s always important to let them have the power, to surprise no one. &quot;Kayro Jane. Media.&quot;

&quot;Gun.&quot;

&quot;No gun. No weapons. I&#39;ve got nothing. A bottle of water if you need it.&quot; Judging by the voice it&#39;s one of the kids. Probably a rat. Brom hasn&#39;t had many hangers-on recently and if he did, the kid would have a gun.

&quot;Water.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s on my belt. You can take it.&quot;

The flask is removed but the knife stays steady.

&quot;Can I turn around?&quot; After a couple of moments it&#39;s obvious the sounds of the up-close fighting have ended. Mostly just regrouping calls and whistles now. And the knife isn&#39;t in your guts. Good job.

It&#39;s too bad though. There&#39;s no story here. Just a couple of bands of jerks blowing off steam, looking for a useless prize.

The knife barely touched you before you whirled, using one of those moves Brom&#39;s goons always &quot;demonstrated&quot; down at Bugs&#39;.

It worked, but mostly cause you had 10 kilos on the wielder, a skinny little punk dressed in rags.

&quot;I&#39;m noncombat,&quot; you say, your knee on his chest. &quot;Kayro Jane. Media.&quot;

The kid knew enough not to thrash, though he was breathing hard. Probably a rat, but it&#39;s always hard to tell. Brom hasn&#39;t had many hangers-on recently and if he did, the kid would have had a gun.

&quot;I&#39;m not your target. I&#39;m going to take your knife and get up. Then you&#39;re going to run. You tell whoever you need to that you almost took down someone big and scary.&quot;

You ease up and let the kid go. He looks longingly at the knife you took. It&#39;s a piece of shit, but he&#39;ll probably get some sort of beating for losing it. But he backs away. Once he&#39;s past a pipe, he starts running.

After a couple of moments it&#39;s obvious the sounds of the up-close fighting have ended. Mostly just regrouping calls and whistles now. And the knife in your hand isn&#39;t in your guts. Good job.

It&#39;s too bad though. There&#39;s no story here. Just a couple of bands of jerks blowing off steam, looking for a useless prize.

&quot;Do you know who I am?&quot; you ask. Your hands waggle. It&#39;s always important to keep the people with the weapons thinking about too many things at once when you&#39;re lying to them. &quot;Kayro Jane. I&#39;m friends with your boss.&quot;

&quot;Gun.&quot;

Aw crap. Judging by the voice it&#39;s one of the rat kids. Probably a rat. Brom hasn&#39;t had many hangers-on recently and if he did, the kid would have a gun. Change it up; act scared. &quot;No gun. I know where the loot is.&quot; 

The knife wobbles.

&quot;Follow the rusty green pipe. They dropped it right by the third wheel interchange. Good gear. I would have taken it myself but it was too heavy.&quot;

You don&#39;t hear any footsteps; the kid is fast and silent but the pressure is gone. You wait a few more beats to make sure you look harmless. &quot;Can I turn around?&quot; She&#39;s long gone, chasing a pipeline to a mirage.

After a couple of moments the sounds of fighting start up some ways down the pipe. A few gunshots. A few screams. But the knife isn&#39;t in your guts. Good job.

It&#39;s too bad though. There&#39;s no story here. Just a couple of bands of jerks blowing off steam, looking for a useless prize.

BludBol bludbol bludbol. This shouldn&#39;t be too hard to find. They&#39;ve been doing this uphive distraction for years down here now. You&#39;re sure that even back before the Interruption and closing of Bugs&#39; for good, he was showing games on screens in there. You remember the flicker. They didn&#39;t have very good resolution. But there was something about a bunch of people together. They were getting into it. Of course they were, it was a spectacle designed to distract them from the way their lives had been violated using as many resources as could be mustered. No one had a chance. But that can&#39;t be the only way it all shakes out. 

There must be games happening out there. Didn&#39;t they build stadiums down here? When is the last time you left your cubicle? 

Of course, there&#39;s going to be BludBol on the EDS. You don&#39;t really need to leave your cube.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="gorefarmers" tags="" position="2000,489" size="200,100">You should cheer for the Gore Farmers!

When the Gore Farmers are good they can be very good, as evidenced by their two Green Cup wins in the modern era. But they can also be really bad, which has led to relegation and terrible seasons and an overall record hovering around .500.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 41-15-44

The Option-Crush approach to BludBol is traditional, simple, but also somewhat arcane. A team can use 4 strong slow and unskilled linemen, 4 faster attacking blitzers, 2 dedicated ball-handlers, 4 weak slow receivers and a nigh-unlimited supply of tough fodder. The basic idea is to get a ball handler into a cage and grind out a 2-1 win, but there are more options for the team that wishes to develop them. The Gore Farmers, for instance, *mostly* eschew the Big Guy approach.

The Gore Farmers and the [[orbitalmachine]] both won the sixth Green Cup (one Classic and one not) and that dispute over which one should really count fuelled their rivalry. The [[darklingspectres]] at this point are the team the Farmers try their best to fend off, as successfully as they have thus far.

Even when they&#39;re bad they aren&#39;t that bad. And when they&#39;re good they&#39;re dazzling. They are the UBBL&#39;s only three-time champions and the only team to have defended a championship.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 61-19-36

The Wyrms use what&#39;s known as the Excelsior playbook, where a fast fragile receiving corps works together downfield making catches in traffic and getting out of trouble. It&#39;s a shorter-passing game than the High Extension playbook used by the [[Glorious Hounds-&gt;glorioushounds]] but when you can avoid injury it&#39;s very effective, as the Wyrms have shown.

As the winningest team in the UBBL, Wyrm fans can be among the most despised. From their end, however, the main rivalries are with the [[Zensun Vagabonds-&gt;zensunvagabonds]] as the two &quot;Founders&quot; of the UBBL, the [[Irregular Cogs-&gt;irregularcogs]] (mostly for historical reasons), and the [[Gore Farmers-&gt;gorefarmers]], who have won more Green Cups in the modern era (and share the Stacks division with them).

The Filthy Tide are often called the best team to never win the Green Cup. They&#39;re an Original 8 team that has had two of the best scorers for their eras in the UBBL but has never been able to convert the big win to get their stars a championship. Now they are in rebuild mode.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 49-12-52

The Filthy Tide uses the Scrying Avian playbook which emphasizes speed above all else, especially the health of your own players. With proper training it&#39;s possible to have a super-fast scorer, which makes the lack of defensive ability easier to overcome.

The Filthy Tide have long been in the shadow of the [[Old Wyrms-&gt;oldwyrms]]. They have had great individual players but no team success. Tide fans see Wyrms supporters as arrogant blowhards, but they hate Wyrms management even more for their unsentimental business first approach to winning. Tide fans also see the [[Badger Claws-&gt;badgerclaws]] as an up and coming rival, and would love to see their star, Aeson, retire, preferably without a Green Cup ring.

They were once thought to be the future of BludBol in the old era UBBL, and were set to play in Green Cup V before the interruption. They&#39;ve never lived up to that, though they are good in Open Division play. They lean more on the passing game than most generalist teams do, which can make them more fun to watch than other teams with a similar playbook.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 16-12-28

The Sump Runners use the Hermann playbook, the original plan for playing BludBol, and the one that every other strategy is an adaptation of. The team has two thrower positions available, 4 catchers, 4 blitzers, a big guy and fills out the rest of the lineup with undistinguished concussion-fodder. The Sump Runners go with have some oddities in their lineup including using a specialist thrower as a makeshift blitzer.

In the past the [[Vanadium Hunters-&gt;vanadiumhunters]] were the Sump Runners&#39; chief rivals, but with them relegated it&#39;s slim pickings. They had a devastating loss to the [[Arborists-&gt;arborists]] in the third UBBL Challenge tournament, which may spark something moving on.

The Carcosan Tatters have always been a very good team. They&#39;re defensive-minded without really flashy stars and can lock a game down to a muddy slog even if the sun is out.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 52-14-35

The Tatters use the Nergal playbook, some (especially fans of pretty BludBol) say it is one of the oldest and most insidious ways to play. The lineup consists of four strong blockers, four blitzing ball handlers and whatever dregs of fodder can be pulled off the street or opposing teams. Their biggest strengths are making everything difficult for the opposition.

The Tatters&#39; main rivals are the [[Orbital Machine-&gt;orbitalmachine]]. They have a similar defensive playbook, but that&#39;s the main basis for any animosity. Fans of the Tatters, like the players on the Tatters, don&#39;t really care much for what other teams do. Aesthetically, they are near diametric opposites of the [[Glorious Hounds-&gt;glorioushounds]] who prefer to make everything graceful and easy looking.

The Arborists are the newest entries for the Green Cup competition, having won the third UBBL Challenge for their shot. They are passers and speedsters and are part of the slow wave of skillifying Pro-Level UBBL.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 0-0-0

The Arborists use the Wary Eagle playbook, which is very similar to the Scrying Avian technique, but with slightly higher skilled (and more expensive to replace) players. The lineup includes four catchers, two blitzers and throwers that have more of an option of holding back and letting fly once the catchers are in position.

As the Arborists are in their first Pro-Level season they don&#39;t have a lot of long-standing rivalries. Among Open-Level teams they bumped heads most with Thorns fans. Coming into GCX though, their natural rivals are the [[Badger Claws-&gt;badgerclaws]] as the other upstart team in the race to be the first of them to win the coveted Cup.

The Badger Claws fought their way into Green Cup play from the Open Division and have never had a season below .500. They also, as of Green Cup X, have the greatest scorer in UBBL history playing for them.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 20-5-12

The Badger Claws use the Scrying Avian playbook which emphasizes speed above all else, especially the health of your own players. With proper training it&#39;s possible to have a super-fast scorer onside, which makes the lack of defensive ability easier to overcome.

The team has a few rivalries going to sustain it. The [[Arborists-&gt;arborists]] are a natural rival as the new upstart little sibling in the Green Cup world, while their use of the same playbook as the [[Filthy Tide-&gt;filthytide]] make for some natural &quot;Who did it better?&quot; kinds of comparisons. Then there&#39;s the [[Kaiju Dynamo-&gt;kaijudynamo]] a team that almost no one takes seriously, but the Claws have consistently had to get through in their playoff runs.

The team of history that has never managed to re-live up to it. The Irregular Cogs won the inaugural Green Cup against their archrivals the [[Old Wyrms-&gt;oldwyrms]]. Then came a long period of good play but few results.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 59-11-43

The Irregular Cogs use the Drop Eagle playbook. It&#39;s an adaptation of the Hermann playbook that again requires more skilled players to run it effectively. The strategy dispenses with the catcher position entirely, instead using four skilled blitzers to run the ball, and two dedicated ball-hawks to attack the opposing ball-carriers. It&#39;s an aggressive defense that does as much work as their offense.

The Cogs and the [[Old Wyrms-&gt;oldwyrms]] are traditional rivals, and the fact the Cogs won the first Green Cup is the bright point for the Cogs in that history. More recently, the [[Orbital Machine-&gt;orbitalmachine]] made the Cogs&#39; shit list in &quot;the Battle of Dungardin&quot; and they&#39;re always looking over their shoulders at the [[Eldritch Fatality-&gt;eldritchfatality]] who use the same playbook.

Usually credited along with the Old Wyrms as the founders of the UBBL, the Vagabonds have a long history of not being great. Which is kind of funny as they did almost win the Green Cup once back in the Old-Era.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 38-23-47

The Vagabonds use the Hermann playbook, the original plan for playing BludBol, and the one that every other strategy is an adaptation of. The team has two thrower positions available, 4 catchers, 4 blitzers, a big guy and fills out the rest of the lineup with undistinguished concussion-fodder. Like most Hermann teams, the Vagabonds don&#39;t use all their specialist receivers, trusting more to a running game with the blitzers.

The Vagabonds&#39; primary rivalry is with the [[Old Wyrms-&gt;oldwyrms]] as the pair of UBBL Founders. They&#39;ve never been nearly as good as the Wyrms, so a lot of fans see themselves as custodians of tradition instead of victory.

A dominant bashing Modern-Era team, the Orbital Machine embodies a team-oriented approach. They inflict a lot of casualties and have the best winning streak in the UBBL (12 wins spanning two seasons).

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 32-7-20

The Orbital Machine uses the Chariot playbook. This involves four massive players on the line with everyone else more lightly armoured but able to blitz like no one&#39;s business. Passing and ball-handling tend to be a secondary consideration and get focused into whichever players show an aptitude while the rest of the team assembles the cage to roll down the field.

Fans of the Machine don&#39;t get on especially well with the other main bashing teams in the Pros (the [[Carcosan Tatters-&gt;carcosantatters]] and [[Gore Farmers-&gt;gorefarmers]]). Adding to the frisson with the Farmers is the disputed nature of the &quot;true winner&quot; of the sixth Green Cup.

The Kaiju Dynamo are a frustrating team to cheer for. They always seem right on the cusp of being really good, then it all falls apart, leaving them as almost exactly a .500 team. Being a Dynamo fan means one is long-suffering.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 45-15-44

The Dynamo use the Elizabeth Aardman playbook, with strong linemen and a big guy anchoring the centre, while the ball handlers are chosen for speed (rather than skill, strength or durability). The basic idea of the playbook is to cage the fragile ballhandler to a place where they can bolt for the endzone.

No one becomes a fan of the Dynamo because they enjoy the easy life. There are always injuries to someone critical to the offense, and training up rookies to take the place of linemen that have cycled out of the lineup means every season has more &quot;developmental&quot; games than a fan who wants quick victory will enjoy.

Dynamo fans have been burned in the past by Scrying Avian teams (so the [[Badger Claws-&gt;badgerclaws]] and [[Filthy Tide-&gt;filthytide]]) and the disparity between their record and number of championships compared to the [[Gore Farmers-&gt;gorefarmers]] always rankles.

The Hounds are all about deep passes to wide open receivers and how that is &quot;the only true way&quot; to play BludBol. They have never quite lived up to their own hype, but it is impossible to deny the prettiness of their game.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 39-9-32

The Glorious Hounds use the High Extension playbook, a venerable adaptation of the Hermann technique. Generally to play this style, you need a higher skill level. The playbook uses four receivers but only two blitzers and no big guy option. The idea is usually for the thrower to hang onto the ball longer than in the Excelsior or Drop Eagle playbooks giving the catchers time to get open downfield.

Hounds fans generally despise teams that aren&#39;t trying to play aesthetically beautiful BludBol, so the [[Ravenous Eagles-&gt;ravenouseagles]] and [[Carcosan Tatters-&gt;carcosantatters]] are the most common targets of their ire.

The Ravenous Eagles are often referred to as the Worst Green Cup Champions, which is all right with the Ossa ownership group as they flaunt their rings.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 25-7-34

The Eagles use the Charles Dorf playbook, which is built on a very rigid division of smash and grab labour. They use slow tacklers on the line to block off the centre, three strong blitzers and a fragile ball-handling corps (which is a faster group than the blockers, but comparatively slow across the league).

Fans of the Ravenous Eagles glory in their championship titles and especially love getting in the faces of fans of the [[Glorious Hounds-&gt;glorioushounds]].

While of late the Darkling Spectres have been mired in mediocrity, they can be an effective defensive team. Their ownership sees the team as primarily a profit centre since on-field results have been hard to come by recently.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 34-12-38

The Spectres use the traditional Unglewort playbook. They have nigh-unlimited cheap slow fodder for the line that funnel opposition towards the reliable massive blockers. Two blitzers attack opposing ball-carriers, and up to four ball-carriers supply all of the speed, though they are very fragile.

The Spectres have come close to winning the Green Cup a couple of times, but have been thwarted by similarily bashing teams. Fans hate it when the schedule comes up against the [[Orbital Machine-&gt;orbitalmachine]] or the [[Gore Farmers-&gt;gorefarmers]].

The Cackling Furies are an Old-Era expansion team that can cause a lot of injuries, but will take a lot in exchange.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 33-19-39

The Furies use the Norton playbook, which is mostly a way to get less skilled players to channel their energy into flinging themselves at the opposition in a terrible frenzy. The use a couple of strong ball-hawks, some blitzers, even receivers, but all one sees when a team is going Norton is whirling masses of limbs and teeth. To do this they can&#39;t protect themselves very well, so there is a lot of roster turnover.

Cackling Furies fans don&#39;t have a lot of rivalries, getting in everyone&#39;s faces about evenly. They do, however, dislike the [[Old Wyrms-&gt;oldwyrms]] quite vehemently. The Furies&#39; style of play can make them quite dangerous to the (fragile) Wyrms as well.

A youngish team, they weren&#39;t active in the Green Cup before the Interruption, but have come along as fierce competitors in the Modern Era, never having worse than a 60% win rate.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 36-8-19

The Eldritch Fatality use the Drop Eagle playbook. It&#39;s an adaptation of the Hermann playbook that again requires more skilled players to run it effectively. The strategy dispenses with the catcher position entirely, instead using four skilled blitzers to run the ball, and two dedicated ball-hawks to attack the opposing ball-carriers. It&#39;s an aggressive defense that does as much work as their offense.

The Fatality have a bit of a chip on their shoulder. They are a really good team that wins wins wins, but then they can&#39;t quite get the championship into their house. The [[Orbital Machine-&gt;orbitalmachine]] and [[Old Wyrms-&gt;oldwyrms]] have both beaten them on their paths to a Green Cup, and the mere fact that such an &quot;objectively lousy&quot; team like the [[Ravenous Eagles-&gt;ravenouseagles]] has won a Cup before them rankles badly. But the lack of Cup success is only a part of using the same playbook as the [[Irregular Cogs-&gt;irregularcogs]] which they are perpetually overshadowed by even though they are the better team these days.

The Brutes have folded because they could not maintain the 33% Winning Rate required to maintain status in the UBBL. They were once a feared casualty-inflicting powerhouse, but now there is only nostalgia.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 10-10-42

The Brutes have folded and the fans mostly don their old blue jerseys ironically these days. Many transferred their allegiances to the [[Ravenous Eagles-&gt;ravenouseagles]], or the Open-Level [[Mules-&gt;mules]].

The Hunters have never managed to achieve a winning season. They are generally a bad team, but they did achieve a Doom Fist in the old-era UBBL. Currently they have been relegated to the Open Division.

Pro Level Record (W-D-L) 19-15-37

The Hunters use the Hermann playbook, the original plan for playing BludBol, and the one that every other strategy is an adaptation of.

The Hunters have been around a long time and in the Old-Era had one of the best players in the business. Their fans love their traditional style and get really angry at teams like the [[kaijudynamo]] who try new-fangled approaches to the game.
