The mass elevator is huge, apparently. One of the largest engineering projects they've done in the spire in at least the last century. Of course the spire itself doesn't count as a project. It's all of creation. But in some way it's easier to think of the spire's hugeness than the elevator's. The spire weighs down on the Stacks, condensing waste and air and emotion to a slurry of depression and rust.

But the elevator is hidden. When they built it, it replaced whole blocks of buildings, most of them were abandoned heaps of slag anyway, best for gangbangers to do their dirty works in. The builders scaffolded up around a huge chunk of Stacksburg, encasing it like a spider with its prey. And then no one saw inside again.

There are tunnels and portals where the independently tracked vehicles uplanders use down here for protection, where they crawl out and deliver supplies from above. Mostly feedstock for printers, though why they need such massive vehicles to do it is one of those colonial weirdnesses you just get used to down here.

But that's an unfair assessment to call them colonials, when everyone is, from top to bottom. Stacksburg isn't being colonized. It's just part of the colonizing machine. The shitty broken part.

There are theories of civilization and of human relationships that are primarily hydraulic in nature. Where we talk about release valves and letting off steam and being under pressure. And all of that has some heft to it, anecdotally. But if you're dealing with a closed system, with a bounded set of coordinates that limit exactly what can happen, it becomes less of a hydraulic metaphor. In a closed system the energy all just changes. Different forms without escape valves, just ebbs and flows.

The mass elevator carries ebbs around so the blood can flow.

The least massive part of the mass elevator is the passenger dock, and that's where you have spent far too long sitting. The waiting room wasn't put together in a fit of optimism. It was created by bureaucrats who knew that anyone coming down from the core wouldn't be spending long in the room, that they wouldn't have anyone of any imprtance waiting to greet them, and that practically nobody from the Stacks would be able to afford to leave. There wasn't a lot of point to making the space comfortable.

Though it makes sense, that doesn't make hanging around here avoiding your responsibilities any more pleasant.

The guard stationed at the bulkhead has a name with a lot of Ns in it, but you can't quite remember the order they go in. According to the slate there are still a few minutes before she'll have to flip her visor from whatever distraction she's playing into the old colonial guard death stare. That is a job that's gotten much better since the elevator came in. Colonial Guard don't get blown up for sport nearly so much any more. Part of those massive crawly tanks showing the flag, sure, but everyone has gotten a bit more mellow since they stopped being so damned poor. 

It's good. You keep telling yourself that. It's way better not to be living in a warzone. Any sane person would agree.

It's just a harder place to tell a story about. And that is your job. As long as your editor hasn't fired[^1] you yet.

[^1]: Fired, like there are such capitalist economics at play in Stacksburg. When no one really needs a job to survive, the whole notion of exploitative profit seems kind of ridiculous, doesn't it? Yet NnnnN is still guarding a door for the powers that be. Is it just for fun if it isn't for profit?

When the bulkhead slides open it's quieter than it should be. Smooter than it should be. The old days of hydraulics and pistons and depleted uranium fusion rods are gone upspire. Or at least their fashions have changed.

And out of the elevator steps a young man. He is not a CG soldier. He's not a gangster and not some dogooder. He's something foreign to the Stacks. You think he might be a businessman.

I didn't have a clue what I'd be stepping into going so far downspire. So yes, naive and all that. I get it. But I didn't expect it to be so boring.

I'd heard the stories about the rough shit that went down down below and figured it couldn't be like that. But I expected something more reflective of the stories? You know, like rusty bloodstains hidden by paint, all old but not forgotten, that kind of thing. But the door slid out of my way and there was a room with bolted down benches and long-neglected posters under plastic. Probably pretty tough plastic but still.

It was dull.

There were two ways to approach dullness, in my opinion. I could assume that all the people living down here would be emblematic of this first impression, that all would hearken to the archetype, that I was entering a world of dull little philistines I'd need to win over with my charm and product. And my razzle and my dazzle would be necessary, maybe I'd have to get in a few scrapes with a farmer's daughter (I suppose they still had hydroponics to tend down here) and in the end they'd fete me before running me out of town on a rail. Up a shaft I guess. And that'd be one kind of story.

But I don't think that's the story I came down to Stacksburg to tell.

The other approach would be to assume hidden depths. To assume a slyness, a craftiness, a defensiveness against some outsider like me. To know that they aren't going to let some shiny trinket man in to turn their world upside down and then vamoose with the profits. This way would be more difficult, would require more planning, more substance.

Which is tough, when the substance you're selling is escape, something I've always held to be the epitome of non-substance.

It could be done though. And if I succeeded? That'd set me up as some kind of legend, I'm sure. Which isn't the point. Never the point. But. It'd be kind of nice. I'd just have to figure out the way to do it.

The dull little waiting room had the virtue of an exit to the streets or the slightly cozier confines of a place called Bugs. Like I said, I didn't know much about the Stacks then, but the thought of eating bugs didn't quite appeal. We get our peculiarities bred in early and I guess I like my proteins vat fed the way the makers intended.

And besides, walking the streets is always the best way to get to know a place, right?

Bugs, of course, is not a course of food, but a former Colonial Guardsman and present to the timelines of this tale bartender. 

He says he fought the xenomin back when they tried attacking the spire. Most people call bullshit on that story, since Bugs has never a) shown any inclination towards skills with violence b) left the Stacks. The invasion proper happened on one of the far spires, and no one can remember not seeing Bugs in his shitty little bar for long enough to have fought in a foreign war in distant lands. 

But he does have a big pincery head of something that looks an awful lot like one of the xenomin warriorpods mounted on the bar's wall. And no one really remembered Bugs making outlandish claims before that thing showed up. So yes. That's Bugs.

He also, as you'll see, has opinions on the topic of bludbol.
