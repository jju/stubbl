# Week Four

This week saw the scoring race really heat up with a new three-way tie for first place between [[Atte]] [[Sabah]] and [[Aeson]] at 7 TDs apiece with [[Costache]] right behind at 6. Player of the Week was the young upstart [[Venus]] with 14 SPP.

## Burger Conference

### Stacks

* Gore Farmers 2-0-2
* Old Wyrms 1-2-1
* Filthy Tide 1-0-3
* TC Sump Runners 1-0-3

The Stacks are not going according to plan, especially not for the defending GCIX champions, but it's all pretty tight.

### Outlands

* Carcosan Tatters 3-1-0
* Arborists 3-0-1
* Badger Claws 3-0-1
* Irregular Cogs 2-0-2

The Badger Claws drew first blood on the Arborists, this week, giving the Tatters the division lead in the league's toughest grouping.

## Classic Conference

### Heaps

* Zensun Vagabonds 2-1-1
* Orbital Machine 1-2-1
* Kaiju Dynamo 1-1-2
* Glorious Hounds 0-2-2

The Hounds have been struggling to make a move, especially worrying since they were hoping for a breakthrough season. The Vagabonds and Machine drew their match this week, which they both might regret if [[Sabah]] continues to heat up and push the Dynamo up the win column.

### Pits

* Ravenous Eagles 2-1-1
* Darkling Spectres 2-1-1
* Cackling Furies 0-3-1
* Eldritch Fatality 0-2-2

The Pits have the most separation between the good teams and the less-so. That those groups are precisely inverted from what was expected in the preseason is surprising, but Eagles fans will take it.
