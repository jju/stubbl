Zaac was the dude in Bugs' far too early on the morning of Fibs 29. It was too early because he beat me there and had already badgered Bugs into putting the game on. Bugs hated bludbol. "People watch and watch and cheer but they never cheer hard enough to spill their beer. Everything's too fucking precious these days." I don't know if he'd said that to Zaac, or if that was a special bonding thing we had. If he'd heard, Zaac didn't seem to have paid Bugs any more mind than me.

This day wasn't just about meeting a source and maybe getting a story out of it, though of course that was in the air. I'd been getting comms from this guy, saying there was a big project in the works. If I was any kind of journalist I'd have to cover it, no questions asked.

Which is of course kind of a funny thing to say to a muckraker like myself. Of course I'll tell a story with no questions asked. It'll be on the same day the lord of the spire comes down in the muck and wipes my ass for me. No video.

But message after message after message piling up accretes its own little story. So on Fibs 27, I picked up.

The voice on the other end stammered a bunch and I got to be all ears while he got his words around his mouth. "This is Kayro Jane right? The writer?"

And I told him yes and he told me there was a story I needed to tell. He repeated his line about the project so big it'd make the mass elevator saga look like yesterday's breakfast.

Spare me the pitch and give me the hook, I told him. He did. "Halfleg Jack wants to come out of retirement."

That was a hook.

I asked where he'd been and got audible handwaves. "I can't talk about it on an open line. You know a place we can talk without ears."

"Bugs'," I said. And we did the standard clarification joke. I'm pretty sure that's the main reason I use that dive as a meeting point. Little things keep you happy and young, especially when you're neither, right?

So he met me at Bugs' and he elaborated. Of course, he was watching the game when I arrived. Week 7 of the Big Show. Usually crucial for determining the playoff bound from the also-rans. The last half of the season turns into two: the quest for winning and the fight to keep from being the big fat loser relegated down below. Like us.

He was skinny and younger than I would have thought. One of the street assholes I've spent too much of my life covering trying to look respectable. I watched him watch the game a bit and well, I was actually a little impressed. Most of these kids seem like they'll vibrate out of their seats the second they stop moving, but when the play was on he was there. He was focused, not a jitter to him. Lips twitched a little and eyes flickered, but nothing in the rest of him.

It didn't mean he knew Halfleg Jack. He probably didn't. He was probably just a grifter with a story to sell, like everyone I didn't know in Stacksburg who knew me real well.

"So here's the thing. Halfleg wants to finish the fifth season. He wants to make it official and get the league recognized, make it legit. He can do it. He wants to come back to the game. He misses the game. And he knows that we miss it too. The people of Stacksburg deserve to have bludbol in their lives again. How much war and destruction did we go through while they were shipping their junk down here?"

That junk was what rebuilt this place, including half the missing limbs from the fighting.

But after that first morning talk I figured this Zaac might not know what he was doing, but he was doing something. I'd take that. I'd help him tell the story of bringing bludbol back to Stacksburg.
