# on games

Perhaps games exist that aren't some microcosm of the worlds they exist in.  Ones that are pure abstractionm removed from everything. The players would be perfectly isolated from the world, at least the top ones would. They would be a true escape. I picture those games with their clean edges determined by the demon spirits of mathematics.

In my world we do things roughly. Less math, more statistics.

But that really is my world. Not everyone is out there trying to put together stories of what happened to some lunkheads who run around after a piece of layrx or skin or whatever. Loads of people are out there just looking for the crunch and groan and snap and blood. 

I have to admit I didn't understand those people for a long time. I was embedded in real life, in politics, in the grit and flash of gangwars all around. Tell the Kayro Jane of 7 or 8 gigaseconds ago she was going to be an expert - well, she'd know experts - in a game she'd ahve been pissed at you.

Fuck my ideals and all that right. That's what the game is is a retreat from reality.

But that's the thing I hope we're going to approach in the next however many words. Games mean things. Everything means something but games don't mean nothing.

So let's talk about bludbol.
