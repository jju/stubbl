Filthy Tide	Sardines	rushing	The league had it in for the Tide. Look at all the injuries they took that were never penalized.	They had the best offensive set pieces for the quick score.	They're without doubt the best team to never win a Green Cup.
Irregular Cogs	Halfleg Jack	rushing	They never had a massive basher, but were great at avoiding turnovers.	All about the short pass to get the ball where it needed to be.	Won the first Green Cup.
