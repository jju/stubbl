The Vagabonds had every opportunity to score in this match but in the end they couldn't recover from a busted cage on their first drive, followed by a non-scoring blitz that totally knocked them off balance. A 1-0 win isn't exactly the style that pleases the notoriously razzledazzly as a player Ozyman, but if Ws are what matter, he's got his first as a head coach. ZV 0 - GH 1
