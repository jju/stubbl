# week 02

The Mules retake the field in week 2, set to defend their Orange Goblet title.

## matchups

 The Mules played a tight Dorfish game to start their Goblet defense, pouncing on an early Thriller mistake and running down the clock in the first half, then getting a 2-0 lead before the final quarter. The value cap is going to hurt teams like the Thrillers, who had been doing so well in the last UBBL Challenge. T 0 - M 2

The Hunters went back to basics to regroup from losing their big offseason signing and put together a highly competent match. R 2 - VH 3

Aelfsige and the Gentlefolk aren't making a very strong claim to remain in the OG tournament early on, but we all know it's a marthon not a sprint. G 0 - WH 3
