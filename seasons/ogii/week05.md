## matchups

 The Warthogs continued their winning ways with another convincing takedown of the Carrion Pickers. #t2574.1
 
 The Gladiolas used a late riot and Joukuhainen's acrobatics to stage a dazzling win over the Geometers and out of the relegation zone. #t2574.3
 
 The Mules ground the Hunters down with excellent defense off the kicks (two perfect defenses in the first half gave them the 1-0 edge going into the second) #t2574.5
 
 The Thrillers exhibited their disgust at being cellar dwellers with the Gentlefolk by laying a 4-0 smackdown on the winless opponents. #t2574.5
 
 Raptors against the Deep Dreamers with a tied record going in, both teams are looking to claim second place at the season's midpoint. The Dreamers pulled it off with a bunch of bobbled passes as they both went for it in the final quarter of the game. #t2574.7
