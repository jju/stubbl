## matchups

The Gladiolas did a number on the Thorns #t2759.1

The Warthogs didn't win, but the draw wasn't enough to pull the Hunters out of the relegation zone. #t2759.3

The Mules and Geometers had a battle of the slow defensive teams. The first half was a 0-0 draw, but the Mules had lost their young Runner [[Shiro]] (who'd been a Halfleg leader t the midpoint of the season) and [[Amalie]] who'd been in the mix for Casualties lost another step of mobility. By the end, the Geometers scored as much as they needed while the Mules have to regroup and figure out a roster for the rest of the season. #t2759.5

A big win helps alleviate some of the pain the Carrion Pickers had been feeling, but they're going to need more to make the playoffs. This win didn't make a difference in the standings. #t2759.7

The Raptors held on to win against the dangerous Thrillers team getting out of the 7th -10th place quagmire.
