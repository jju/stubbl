## matchups

The Hunters did what they needed to attempt getting out of the crab bucket, by defeating the sad-sack Gentlefolk, who need more than 2 wins in their final four matches to not be forced into oblivion after the season concludes. #t2760.1

The Thrillers clawed back up the bucket, allowing no separation going into the final weeks of the season, but getting the slight edge over the Carrion Pickers. #t2760.3

The volatility of the standings made itself felt again, where the Thorns picked up a big win and vaulted from the relegation zone over the crabbucket into second place on the season by beating the Geometers. #t2760.5

The Warthogs were handed their first loss of the season by the Gladiolas who are are now in second place, where they probably should be by talent level. #t2760.7

The Mules had a terrible first half and a stellar second in a match that saw [[Nkosana]]'s return to the pitch and [[Pilvi]] the rookie to replace Shiro having a great debut. Not a win, but both teams are satisfied with the draw to move slightly above the roiling mass that is fighting for a playoff spot. #t2670.9
