## matchups

The Gentlefolk were destroyed 7-0 in their final match, which makes for a fitting end to their UBBL existence, having now dropped below the 33% overall win rate required. After a long season the Gladiolas grabbed first seed and put the pressure on the Warthogs to win in Week 11 if they want it back. #t2763.1

The Mules got the necessary win to make the playoffs assuming there are no disasters, while the Thorns remain qualified. #t2763.3

The Raptors made the Carrion Pickers work and ended up winning and carrying the new team banner into the OGII playoffs. #t2763.5
