## matchups

The Gentlefolk were destroyed 7-0 in their final match, which makes for a fitting end to their UBBL existence, having now dropped below the 33% overall win rate required. After a long season the Gladiolas grabbed first seed and put the pressure on the Warthogs to win in Week 11 if they want it back. #t2763.1

The Mules got the necessary win to make the playoffs assuming there are no disasters, while the Thorns remain qualified. #t2763.3

The Raptors made the Carrion Pickers work and ended up winning and carrying the new team banner into the OGII playoffs. #t2763.5

In a match with no relegation implications, the Hunters did a good job to grab the third seed over the Dreamers. If their catchers play that well in the playoffs the Hunters could get a real prize out of all this. #t2763.7

The Geometers made the last regular season matchup a thrilling one with a dying moments dive for the endzone to achieve a post-season berth (at the expense of the Thorns who'd assumed they had a path to the postseason even with a week 11 loss). #t2763.9
