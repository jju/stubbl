# orange goblet II finals

#t2766


## schedule

* Mules - Raptors


## results

The Raptors' medical squad was all used up on their opening drive, but they didn't let up until [[Ella]] snuck through for a TD. Things seemed on track for the Mules to tie it up when Nkosana was sacked right by the line. An Interception and pass back to Nkosana by Lambert gave the Mules the TD they needed if they were'n't going to be playing catchup in the second half. They were on their way to a late score, but as the Mules were running down the clock the Raptors sacked [[Nkosana]]. We went to overtime again. This time the Raptors had to kick so they weren't going to be able to surprise the Mules the way they did the Warthogs. But could the Mules play a drive where scoring quickly would win? No. They could not. [[Lambert]] ended Francine's career but [[Ella]] managed another TD and won the match and the second Orange Goblet.
