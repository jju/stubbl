# week 01

Wow. Did free agency ever fuck up the Vanadium Hunters. Donat played one half of BludBol for the team and was promptly killed. By the crowd. The grand experiment has probably come to an end.

## matchups

 The Carrion Pickers did their best against a Thorns team that really is good. Even with equalized team values they couldn't handle a superior, more efficient socring touch.
