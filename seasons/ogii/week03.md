# week 03

The negotiations over the Value Cap continue and the skilled players are beginning to be heard. Grumbling over forcing teams to bench productive members that would be generating more excitement is building.

## matchups

 The Gladiolas were pretty confident going into the second half of their match up 3-0 on the Dreamers. Then boom boom boom they came out with a draw. Part of that may have been from playing shorthanded the entire match, but damn. Gla 3 - DD 3 #t2752.1
 
 Warthogs vs Mules #t2752.3 The Mules' win streak finally ended to another tough slow bashy team. The Warthogs may have found the key to beating the Mules is kicking to them. Also this win gives them a nice handle on first place, early in the tournament. W 3 - M 1
 
 Gentlefolk vs Geometers #t2752.4 The Geometers did not make any mistakes in this one and tromped through a Gentlefolk team that is surely bound for a last-place finish this tournament, especially with the loss of [[aelfsige]]. Gen 0 - Geo 3
 
 The Hunters did a bang-up job with their rookies on the field, as if to show everyone they didn't actually need the high-priced import who fell apart after all. VH 3 - Th 0 #t2572.6
