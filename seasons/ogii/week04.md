# week 04

The negotiations over the Value Cap continue. While the team owners take a hard line, the Pros are considering work action to support their Open division compatriots. But in the mean time, matches continue.

## matchups

 Another week, another draw for the Gladiolas but this one was them pushing the Mules to take chances to win, which they couldn't capitalize on. Then Shiro stumbled at the last moment and that was all she wrote. M 1 - G 1 #t2573.1
 
 The Gentlefolk continue their bottom-dwelling, this week losing a rookie Heavy. The Carrion Pickers took good advantage to escape the ranks of the winless. CP 3 - Gen 2 #t2573.2
 
 The Thrillers seek to start turning this wreck around by laying down a commanding win over the hot-so-far Dreamers. T 3 - DD 0 #t2572.4
 
 The big turnaround where the Raptors grabbed the Draw from the Geometers in the dying moments.  #t2572.6
