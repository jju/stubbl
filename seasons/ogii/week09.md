## matchups

The Gentlefolk got a win against the defending champions no less! The Mules' revamped lineup with some extra muscle backfired terribly. #t2761.1

 The Hunters vaulted up the standings, but there's still room for them to be caught as the third relegation-fodder team. Escaping that role is going to be much harder for the Carrion Pickers now, a full win behind 9th place. #t2761.3
 
 The Deep Dreamers recaptured a bit of their early season magic against the Geometers #t2761.5
 
The Warthogs held off the Thorns to keep first place. #t2761.7

The Thrillers couldn't get the win they needed to escape the relegation zone and they only have one chance to scramble out of the hole, if the Mules and Raptors let them. #t2761.9
