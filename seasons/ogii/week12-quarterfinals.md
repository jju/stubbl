# quarterfinals

#t2764

The [[thorns]] who came second in OGI did not make the playoffs in OGII. There's some talk about how they shouldn't have let up the gas against the [[mules]] in the final week, but it didn't appear to be a full blown thrown match.

## schedule

The Thorns, Carrion Pickers and Gentlefolk have been eliminated from consideration for the second Orange Goblet leaving these matchups 

* [Gladiolas](../teams/gladiolas)[[gladiolas]] - Thrillers (G won 4-3 in Week 9 and 3-2 in UCIV QF)
* Warthogs - Raptors (W won 2-0 in Week 6)
* Vanadium Hunters - Mules (M won 2-0 in Week 5)
* Deep Dreamers - Geometers (DD won 3-1 in Week 9)

So if past performance indicates anything about future success, we should see the favourites win (possibly apart from the Mules, who were also the underdog standings-wise every playoff round in OGI before winning the title.)

The [Gladiolas](../../teams/gladiolas)[[gladiolas]]-Thrillers match could be the highest scoring. The Deep Dreamers' aggressive interception strategy doesn't give them much of an advantage against the ground-pounding Geometers. The Raptors have the muscle to put up a fight against the big front line of the Warthogs, but they'll have to resist getting too cute on offense, especially running out their sparkly playoff lineup. Can the Mules put together another upset reel as the 7th place seed?

## results

The Deep Dreamers laid on the pressure without even blitzing and were up 3-0 at the half. [[mihael]] was almost knocked out of the game in the first half but the medical team brought him back and he scored the Dreamers' third TD. They scored again in the second half but focused on keeping the Geometers from moving the ball. It was successful and the Dreamers move on to the semifinals. #t2764.1

The Hunters won the toss and tried to force the Mules out of their preferred play style. That put [[Renatus]] on the field to start the match, and put a target on [[Boguslaw]]. The goal was to attack the ball early and score, wasting the "secret weapon" and making the Mules play catch-up. Renatus did take Boguslaw out of the match late in the first half as the Mules kept control of the ball despite Gautstafr's best efforts. The Mules opened the second half with a good show of defense and took out Marta and sent Gautstafr into the crowd where he was knocked out. The Hunters scored on their weak side, but Gautstafr didn't come back to play defense on the ensuing kick. The Mules managed to hang onto the ball the rest of the half, with [[Nkosana]] crossing the line as the clock ticked down.

The Raptors weren't overly aggressive on defense in the first half, but [[Greaves]] managed to make the Warthogs use their medical staff when she fouled [[Omiros]], thereby justifying her inclusion on the playoff roster. They played it safe down the field, the only risk letting [[Hercules]] take the ball into the endzone. Then in the second half Greaves fouled the Warthogs' thrower [[Hursit]] outwith a serious concussion and the upstart Raptors seemed to be running away with it. The Warthogs then ran out a desperation lineup with Primitiva poised to toss Ragu for a quick score. Amazingly, it worked! A pitch invasion on the kickoff left the Raptors with fewer speedy options to open up the lead again so they'd have to play defensively. They caged up around Francine but when the cage was burst, she dashed safely to the sidelines, only to meet up with [[Borislav]] who sprung the ball out where the rookie named Burger got it to [[Omiros]] to head downfield to tie the match up (which they did after a bit of a scrum). Overtime began with a kick to the Raptors. With a timely quick snap, they got the ball to [[Ella]] who dashed for the endzone before the Warthogs could even react, winning the match and getting the upset.

[[Euri]] scored three times in the first half of the Gladiolas-Thrillers match and showed how they own this matchup. It was never close and the Gladiolas made it through without any injuries.
