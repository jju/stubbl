# quarterfinals

#t2764

The [[thorns]] who came second in OGI did not make the playoffs in OGII. There's some talk about how they shouldn't have let up the gas against the [[mules]] in the final week, but it didn't appear to be a full blown thrown match.

## matchups

The Thorns, Carrion Pickers and Gentlefolk have been eliminated from consideration for the second Orange Goblet leaving these matchups 

* Gladiolas - Thrillers (G won 4-3 in Week 9 and 3-2 in UCIV QF)
* Warthogs - Raptors (W won 2-0 in Week 6)
* Vanadium Hunters - Mules (M won 2-0 in Week 5)
* Deep Dreamers - Geometers (DD won 3-1 in Week 9)

So if past performance indicates anything about future success, we should see the favourites win (possibly apart from the Mules, who were also the underdog standings-wise every playoff round in OGI before winning the title.)

The Gladiolas-Thrillers match could be the highest scoring. The Deep Dreamers' aggressive interception strategy doesn't give them much of an advantage against the ground-pounding Geometers. The Raptors have the muscle to put up a fight against the big front line of the Warthogs, but they'll have to resist getting too cute on offense, especially running out their sparkly playoff lineup.
