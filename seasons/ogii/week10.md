# week 10

#t2762

## matchups

The Thrillers closed out their season with a win, putting the pressure on everyone (except the Warthogs and Gladiolas) to get a win in their closing matches since now no one else is safely out of relegation range. #t2762.1

The Gentlefolk got to play massive spoilers with another win, which is what they required to avoid being dismantled for parts in the offseason. The Raptors are now in must-win territory for the final week of the regular season. #t2762.3

A win for the Mules would have pushed them out of range of relegation, but they succumbed to second-half blitzing from the Carrion Pickers and will need to claw their way into the playoffs next week. #t2762.5

The Gladiolas and Hunters got a draw, and the Dreamers have come within striking distance of top seed in the playoffs
