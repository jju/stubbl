## schedule

* [Gladiolas](../teams/gladiolas)[[palaceorchids]] - Raptors (R won 3-2 in Week 1)
* Deep Dreamers - Mules (M won 3-0 in Week 6)


## results

The Deep Dreamers couldn't score on their opening drive which set up the Mules for a 1-0 first half lead. Mihael and Tenskawatwa were both knocked out to open the second half so they were missing two main pressure putters. The Mules hung onto the ball and stumped down the field, coming away with another upset win and another Orange Goblet appearance.

In the dying moments of the first half [[Eufemia]] had a chance to connect with [[Euri]] downfield in traffic, but she botched the pass, letting the Raptors take a 1-0 lead into the second half. The Raptors received in the second half and despite a daring raid on the ball, they couldn't get the ball away from the Raptors, who regrouped and marched down the field for another victory.
