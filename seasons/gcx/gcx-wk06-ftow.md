OW take kick, two balls into the fans later and Emilios gets it to Olaug for the TD. Riot. Hadassah BHs Olaug immediately to open up the lane for Veens. Septimus-Aleksy-Veens and TD scored. Modest responded with another TD. Just barely avoiding a touchback the Wyrms tried to change up their defense but the Tide went up the other flank with Veens who scored again. Pitch Invasion clobbered the Tide's right flank but with Elvis also down, the Wyrms couldn't make the deep pass to put them up at halftime. In the opening kickoff, the Wyrms executed a perfect defense and Kelemann kept Veens from doing her thing down the sidelines. Elisavet smahed Hadassah's collarbone and Eimilios scored a TD. Aleksy fumbled the pickup on the next kick exposing Veens, who got her leg broken by Eimilios while Seosamh waltzed in for the TD. On the kickoff there was another riot, but the Tide had pulled their delicate players back to defend them. Septimus did score, but the loss was already counted. And then Seosamh gratuitously gouged Septimus' eye.
