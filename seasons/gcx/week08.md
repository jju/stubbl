## matches to watch

The rivalry match between the Irregular Cogs and the Old Wyrms is probably the most anticipated match of the week, although a lot of people are interested in how the Dynamo will respond to losing Sabah, their legendary offensive star. And the Spectres are taking on Aeson's heavily favoured Badger Claws this week. I'm sure the Claws' medical staff is ready to prevent a repeat of what happened to Sabah. Then there's the issue of whether the Vagabonds can hold onto first overall while the Arborists are hellbent on returning to the win column. (They are now projected to finish first in the Heaps, even if they lose this match for whatever that's worth.)

## recap

Kendrick saved the first half for the Machine. Venus managed to tie it up at 2 through a tiny gap, and then scored when she was put on defense. All around, a good Tide match, and one that might see the second half of the season not be a total waste. FT 3 - OM 2

The odds were pretty even going into this match despite the Dynamo's loss of Sabah in Week 7, but a last-minute skill dump put journeymen on the field and should have made this easy picking for the Fatality. KD 0 - EF 3

The Hounds were being given the edge and they took it, with a thorough clock-cleaning. Asked after the match, none of the Farmers could explain. "It just wasn't our game today." With the Machine's loss, that pulled the Hounds out of the Heaps' cellar. GF 1 - GH 5

The Furies' Shashi plowed through to TDs while the Sump Runners flicked the ball around to multiple scorers. A big scrum at the end kept the ball in the Runners' hands instead of allowing a draw. CF 3 - SR 4

Live by the crowd, die by the crowd. Channing took a rock to the head giving him a serious concussion in the first half. After the Claws went up 2-0 another rock took out Henry (formerly of the Dynamo) right in the eye. By the end of the match the Claws had a win, Aeson had a few more points in his Sardines Crown run, and the Spectres performed more like the team they were expected to be. DS 0 - BC 4

IC - OW (Even)

CT - RE (Even)

AR - ZV (AR)
