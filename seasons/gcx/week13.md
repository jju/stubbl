## matches to watch





## recap

The Cogs surged into first-place overall (but the rivals haven't had their matches yet) and the loss gives the Filthy Tide another chance to get some breathing room on the Sump Runners. SR 0 - IC 4

The Filthy Tide survived a few scares (including a last minute medical assist on Venus) to get the win and pull ahead of the Sump Runners with enough time to allow some rest in the playoff runup. FT 4 - EF 3

The Gore Farmers did a good job keeping this one attainable, but in the end couldn't find the endzone that last time. The Claws crawled up from the Outlands basement, at least until the Arboreal Menace play their match. BC 3 - GF 2

The Arboreal Menace reclaimed their early season form and stayed ahead of the Badger Claws in the Outlands. AR 5 - DS 2

The Glorious Hounds are losing their chance at bringing Ziba and their quick-score technique into the playoffs, while the Old Wyrms have found their defending champions groove. GH 2 - OW 5

The Vagabonds lost Jonah for this match and the next early, and couldn't put up anything to counter the aggressiveness of the Furies. Luanna got her completions to keep her comfortably atop that race. One has to wonder if the Vagabonds will be able to make any headway in the playoffs after squandering their early season performance. ZV 0 - CF 5
