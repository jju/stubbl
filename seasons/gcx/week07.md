## matches to watch

A less exciting week than number six, but we do get to see the league's 2 top teams duke it out in the Gore Farmers vs Carcosan Tatters. The Cogs Arborists game has a good chance of being rematched in the playoffs, so it should be a good test of the Arborist skill against a skillful team. Otherwise, the Heaps are the division with a lot of pressure attached to their matches. Whoever loses will start having to play catchup as the season progresses. Atte Aeson and Sabah are all ready to resume hostilities in the TD race, with Aeson having the easiest path to the endzone.
