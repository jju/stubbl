## matches to watch

A less exciting week than number six, but we do get to see the league's 2 top teams duke it out in the Gore Farmers vs Carcosan Tatters. The Cogs Arboreal Menace game has a good chance of being rematched in the playoffs, so it should be a good test of the Arborist skill against a skillful team. Otherwise, the Heaps are the division with a lot of pressure attached to their matches. Whoever loses will start having to play catchup as the season progresses. Atte Aeson and Sabah are all ready to resume hostilities in the TD race, with Aeson having the easiest path to the endzone.

## recap

The Tide entered this match without their young star, and oof, did the Furies ever beat the tar out of them. By the end of the first half, the Tide were down to 6 players, and the final drive saw solely Furies on the pitch. FT 0 - CF 3

The Vagabonds could claim first place overall with a win until the GF - CT match resolves. The blizzarding weather cost the Fatality a halftime lead when Atte tried to head for the endzone to catch a pass from Beatrix on her pick. Then the weather cleared up in the second, allowing the Vagabonds to control a battered field and get a comfortable win, and first-place overall (until the Farmers and Tatters have their Round 7 match). Atte didn't score in this match, leaving room for Aeson to take control of the Sardines race this week. EF 1 - ZV 2

The Badger Claws really didn't want to lose this match to an almost last-place team, not with the demands of the Outlands division upon them. Despite a subpar performance by their throwers, they did squeak out a draw. The Hounds have to be happy with their performance, even if they did lose a couple of blockers. GH 3 - BC 3

The Eagles hold first in the Pits with a grinding defensive draw, while the Sump Runners eke out a tiny bit of breathing room from the Tide. The two players who stayed on the benches won the fan MVP awards. SR 1 - RE 1 

The Spectres had an off week in 6 but match up well against the Dynamo normally. As usual, things depend on Sabah. When Sabah was crowdsurfed to death by Channing in the dying moments of the first half, Dynamo fans everywhere shattered. The rest of the match didn't even need to happen (and the Spectres gladly scooped up the win) as now the team is going to be forced into a rebuild. KD 2 - DS 4 

The Machine had a tough match against a speedy scoring team in week 6, and hoped to do a better job bashing the Wyrms into submission. They didn't succeed and the Wyrms are looking more like defending champions by the round. OW 3 - OM 1

One point separates these two in the Stacks, and while the season won't be lost here whoever loses the match could start having troubles. The Arboreal Menace came close to giving this one up, but managed to get a draw, leaving the Outlands in pretty much the same state as the week started. IC 3 - AR 3 

That could have been our preview of the Burger Conference final, and was exactly the battle for first-place overall that we should have been expecting. The Gore Farmers and Carcosan Tatters traded blows and though the Farmers had a chance at the very end to crack it open, they couldn't capitalize and we end up with a draw. GF 2 - CT 2
