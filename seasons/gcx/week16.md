## matches to watch

When the Eagles and Spectres last met the Eagles earned a solid win on the backs of a heavy casualty game by Jantine and Ekua killing off the Spectres' star in the opening drive. The Spectres are more balanced now so this should be a pretty exciting bashy match. 

## recap

Though the Spectres tried to leap out to an aggressive offensive position, the Eagles controlled this match impeccably. The Spectres' stars were rendered ineffective in a big knotty brawl and the march toward a second disrespected Green Cup (to go with their probable Iron Fist) continues for the Eagles.

The Tatters came in prepared for the Aeson offensive and played out the first half exactly how they wanted it. Their defense wasn't quite gapless though and Aeson scored in the dying seconds with the bare minimum time allowed. In the second half the Tatters line held up and they got the ball from the Claws and proceeded to try and run down the clock since they had the final possession. The receiving corps of the Claws fought murderously to keep harassing the Tatters and squeezed the ball free for an end-to-end dash, putting the Badger Claws ahead with no time for the Tatters to respond. A thrilling match, and a nice counterpoint to the offensive-mania outpoured in Week 15.

The Kaiju Dynamo continue their improbable Green Cup run with a dominant display that was notable for their caution and conservatism which they had gotten away from. Vardan played well, and did succumb to a bit of glory hogging from Starfin, but it worked out. And there weren't any serious injuries to mar their next matchup with the Vagabonds.

The Tide forced overtime after a series of Venus' missteps, but they couldn't stop Bent and Nuru for connecting in the endzone to end the season.
