All Roster rules have been tightened up after the Moirin incident in the GCIX final. Now teams are allowed to have only 4 veterans on the reserve roster. They can still have a stable of journeymen and rookies if they want. Also, any star or better (51+ SPP), will get another payday if moved off and then brought back to the active roster (previously only players who had peaked were "entitled" to the payday (which meant it was used for a very mercenary analysis on ownership's part).

| Burger Conference | | Classic Conference | |
|---------------------|--|------------|----|
| *Stacks* | *Outlands* | *Heaps* | *Pits* |
| Old Wyrms | Badger Claws | Glorious Hounds | Eldritch Fatality |
| **Filthy Tide** | Irregular Cogs | Kaiju Dynamo | **Ravenous Eagles** |
| **Gore Farmers** | Arboreal Menace | **Zensun Vagabonds** | **Cackling Furies** |
| TC Sump Runners | Carcosan Tatters | **Orbital Machine** | Darkling Spectres |

Other projection systems (which usually don't do as well before the season) flipped the order of some of these finishes (bolded in the above table), but the general consensus is that the Old Wyrms are in a good position to defend their championship, the Burger Conference will again be the stronger one, and the Darkling Spectres will be bad.
