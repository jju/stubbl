# schedule

* Old Wyrms - Gore Farmers
* Irregular Cogs - Badger Claws
* Zensun Vagabonds - Kaiju Dynamo
* Cackling Furies - Ravenous Eagles


## matches to watch

The Cogs and the Claws are a rematch of the division final in GCIX, though the Claws were not sneaking in in quite the same way. Again though, we'll see if pure offense can overwhelm an aggressive defence.

The Old Wyrms vs. Gore Farmers in the multiple-winner battle that is the purest skill vs bash contest left before a possible Final.

Zensun Vagabonds vs. Kaiju Dynamo have the only division that doesn't have a past-champion representative.

Cackling Furies vs. Ravenous Eagles are the bashy teams that could foil a skilled adversary.

## recap

The Wyrms took advantage of the Gore Farmers over-aggression in the first half by scoring after a stretch pass went awry. Then Aemulus scored just a bit too quickly to tie it up and the Wyrms could take a lead into the second. The Farmers pounced and were playing to tie it up, relying on blocking in a scrum to get them through, but in the end they needed to score and when they left their cages, the ball popped out and the Wyrms iced the match. So the Stacks champions are continuing to defend their title. OW 3 - GF 1

The Dynamo's run as spoilers came to an end and the Vagabonds got their well-deserved division championship. ZV 5 - KD 1

The Badger Claws pulled off their second upset of the playoffs, which is a bit less impressive when you count them having the greatest BludBol scorer the UBBL has ever seen, but still. They did what they needed to do against the season's best team and now get to face the Old Wyrms for another probable scorefest (and rematch of the GCIX Burger Conference Final). IC 5 - BC 6

The Furies never got their offense going against a tough steady Eagles team that is building up their finals-bound juggernaut. CF - RE 2
