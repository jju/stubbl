## matches to watch



## recap

Aeson was apparently prepared to fight to be on the field defensively in order to win and to chase the Sardines Crown. The sweltering heat knocked his teammates out anyway so even after romping into the endzone for the match's first TD he was being sent back out. The Claws pulled off a lightning blitz and Aeson screamed for the ball again and scored again, and that's how the match went, get the ball to the megastar and he would pull the team into the postseason all by himself. He did have to take Klim's place once before the first half was done, and the blitz/interception/fliptoTD from Sunny made the play worth it. He kept on scoring throughout the match, racking up 9 TDs and the MVP for a best ever performance. But was it enough to make the playoffs? That's up to the Arboreal Menace and Wyrms. BC 9 - SR 3

The Arboreal Menace scored first, but were overwhelmed by the Old Wyrms' defence after that. They tried to push too hard and made bad stumbles and the Wyrms played nearly flawlessly. Not the debut season the Arboreal Menace wanted and now they will be fighting to stay in the Green Cup for next season. AR 2 - OW 6

The Fatality could not put a win together, so the Spectres have no pressure as they enter the playoffs. OM 2 - EF 1

The Gore Farmers and Cackling Furies achieved a fairly meaningless draw, though Luanna was seriously injured, which means their (secured) first round bye will be very welcome. CF 1 - GF 1

The Cogs won and secured the bye to rest their injured players. That should have been enough to get at least a Tough Brake Award by the end of the season. DS 1 - IC 2

The Dynamo fielded a ragged team of scrubs to end their regular season and to the relief of the Vagabonds, didn't pull out a win with them. CT 4 - KD 1

Venus chipped away at Aeson's surprising TD lead, and the Eagles trooped through the muck to a loss, but an inconsequential one for the standings. FT 2 - RE 1

The Vagabonds ended the season with a convincing win and the Hounds are bowing out for their UBBL Challenge. ZV 4 - GH 0
