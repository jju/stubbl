* Old Wyrms - Badger Claws
* Zensun Vagabonds - Ravenous Eagles


## matches to watch

The Burger Conference Wyrms vs Claws matchup is a rematch from GCIX, and Aeson at the very least is looking for as many TDs as he can find. Defense will be scarce, especially with the Claws missing Olanrewaju and his ball-hawking for the match.

In the Classic Conference we have two historical underachievers, but one who has done this title-run thing in recent memory.

## recap

The Wyrms won the toss, putting the Claws defense to the test right off the hop. Would they try to actually force turnovers, or simply trade TDs? The anticiaption was palpable. The Claws challenged on the Wyrms first drive, but the TD happened, then in order to deal with the strong flanks the Wyrms put up, Pippin was sent in to punch a hole for Aeson, but he got carried away in the moment and Cleve messed up his pickup, leaving Seosamh an opening. The Claws retrieved the ball but Kelemann intercepted Consolo's pass to Aeson. A flip to Modest and the score was 2-0. Then Consolo muffed the pickup, after Cleve was out with broken ribs. Seosamh grabbed the ball and got the TD. The claws fans were writhing in agony by this point. Aeson scored to end the first half, but they would need a miracle to come back and head for the Green Cup. Aeson delivered on the opening kickoff, while the rest of the team kept the ball away from Consolo, who'd botched too much already. Then after trading TDs again, the Claws got a well-timed blitz and Rati failed to make her block, allowing Klim to dart through for a game-tying TD. They traded scores again, and we were knotted at 5 going into the endgame. The Wyrms could not make their 6th TD too soon, because then the Claws could tie (and put them in an eeire reminiscence of the GCIX Burger Conference Final's finale). They did learn their lesson and after Sunny made a valiant effort to thwart the strategic decision with a ball stripping, Seosamh scored the winning TD as the clock wound down. OW 6 - BC 5

It was a harrowing first half for Vagabond fans, but when Padma finally scored at the end the game hadn't slipped totally away. They were needing that hope going into the end of the second half as well, but Chikondi made the sack before the Vagabonds could get the tying score. The Eagles turned the loose ball into an end to end TD run and the Vagabonds' best season ever died. ZV 1 - RE 3
