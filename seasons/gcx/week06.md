## matches to watch

This week is one that has a lot of good storylines. The Arboreal Menace try to regroup and win against bashing after a couple of speedy opponents. The Filthy Tide and the Old Wyrms have an important divisional match that could keep everything knotted up or really open up the Stacks. The Cogs and the Fatality are both in their divisional basements and now have to claw at each other using the same playbook. And the Vagabonds-Spectres match might be an interesting case of under-regarded second-place teams having an exciting match.

## recap

Battling for tops in the Outlands and the entire league. The Claws received the kick and Aeson scored, then the Tatters drew out the rest of the half to score, but most of their injuries were only minor and the Badger Claws' medical staff got everyone back out on the field to start the second half. The Tatters managed to play the long game, and scored as late as possible to take the lead, putting all the pressure on Aeson to tie up the match in the dying seconds. Aeson succumbed to the pressure and made a rare stumble and the Tatters won. BC 1 - CT 2

Going into this match the Tide didn't have the money to hide Venus when the defense took the field. The first half went for the Tide, giving them a 2-2 draw going into the second, but then a perfect defensive read stopped Venus from traipsing down the sidelines and on the ensuing kick Aleksy fumbled the pickup, giving the Wyrms a 2-TD lead after they broke Venus' leg (she should be okay). Just a gut-punch of a match for the Filthy faithful, and a real boost for the Wyrms. Also of note, a Sump Runner win starts to leave the Tide out of the playoff picture entirely (UPDATE: the Sump Runners lost). FT 3 - OW 4 [[gcx-wk06-ftow]]

With two Drop Eagle playbooks clashing from the bottom of their divisions this one turned out to be a decent rivalry match. The Cogs defense scored twice in the first half, showing the Fatality how to Drop Eagle. The opening drive of the second got the Fatality a TD from their defense, but then the Cogs just got in the passing lanes and won. (Atte didn't score, leaving her watching the Badger Claws match closely.) EF 1 - IC 4 

The Sump Runners went into this match without their muscle, hoping to play a finesse game against their intradivisional rival. The Farmers bashed the Runners down to a lineup of 6 players through the first half, but couldn't score. The Farmers then dominated the second half with enough time to practice some cute passing tricks around Shay and got their win. SR 0 - GF 1 

Sabah, star of the Dynamo, the lynchpin of their offense, was taken out by a blitz before the ball hit the ground, but they managed to bring a 2-0 lead into halftime. By midway through the second half the Hounds were reduced to a 5-player lineup. The final score does not indicate what a laugher this one was, but if this is a playoff matchup the Dynamo might not get so lucky. GH 2 - KD 3

The Spectres and Vagabonds traded TDs throughout and it came down to a matter of possession timing that put the Vagabonds on top in one of their best matches in recent memory. The Vagabonds are having their best offensive season ever with a TD/GP rate over pi. ZV 5 - DS 4 

A win for either would have put them on top of their divisions, but the draw leaves them in the middle of the fray. It looks like the Arboreal Menace do better against bashing teams so far.  OM 2 - AR 2

The fight for first in the Pits was won in the first half when the Eagles' defense swallowed up the Furies attack. After that it was mostly just a case of defending until Humbert could make a timely endzone run. (There were a few palpitations before that, but we always gloss over a bit.) RE 2 - CF 1
