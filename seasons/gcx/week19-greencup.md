* Old Wyrms - Ravenous Eagles


## matches to watch

A match of skill vs brawn between two former champions. Earlier in the season when these teams met, they duelled to a draw with a great number of trips and slowdowns keeping the Wyrms at bay. The lack of Rati, the veteran blitzer for the Wyrms could be a bit of a muscle problem.

## recap

The Wyrms didn't dominate and the Eagles kept the ball in a scrum for most of the match, or at least as long as they could. In overtime the defense looked like it was going to force a turnover and give the Eagles a second underdog Green Cup, but Seosamh dodged their way to the end zone and victory.
