* Old Wyrms - Ravenous Eagles


## matches to watch

A match of skill vs brawn between two former champions. Earlier in the season when these teams met, they duelled to a draw with a great number of trips and slowdowns keeping the Wyrms at bay. The lack of Rati, the veteran blitzer for the Wyrms could be a bit of a muscle problem.
