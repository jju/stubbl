## matches to watch

After a week with a lot of draws, the teams that did get wins are looking to open up some gaps. We're watching the Arborists' match against the Gore Farmers to see if they can hang onto their standings lead when faced with a former Green Cup champion. The Old Wyrms and the Badger Claws could be a high scoring affair, and a real test of how the Claws perform when they can't lean on Aeson for scoring. And for those who like nostalgia, one of those Original 8 matchups is happening in the Vagabonds vs. the Cogs.

## recap

The Spectres have a long way to go this season, but they are stifling a bunch of their offseason critics with their early competitiveness. CF 2 - DS 3

The Fatality had two moments in this match when they could have turned the tables, but they botched those crucial possessions each time. This hasn't been the start to the season they wanted. EF 0 - RE 1

An ugly gutslugger of a match where no one did anything but roll in the mud. FT 0 - CT 1

Without Aeson, the Claws were forced to take a more balanced approach again, and this time the results weren't as good. OW 4 - BC 3

Now it starts to get personal among the incumbent Green Cup teams. Who will be the first to defeat the upstart Arborists? GF 2 - AR 3

The Sump Runners played a careful match and didn't panic when their lead evaporated in the second half. Much better than their last few matches. GH 2 SR 3

The Dynamo completed one pass in this match. That was their high point. KD 0 - OM 2

**The Vagabonds played a nigh-quintessential standard BludBol match. Jonah is on his way to becoming quite good, even if he is destined to be overshadowed by the Green Cup stars. IC 2 - ZV 3** #recap #textbook
