## matches to watch

The Arborists have kept their winning going, so now we're definitely watching their matchup with the Eagles with great interest.  It will also be good to see if the Badger Claws can bounce back from a tough week previous, and a Farmers-Wyrms matchup of the multiple champions is often entertaining.

## recap

The Vagabonds took advantage of the Tide's lack of organized threat to run away with this one. It's hard to say if they can keep this up, but they're playing quite well so far this season. FT 1 - ZV 4

A pretty mild game for Aeson even despite his rare defensive TD, but a wild finish to preserve the win and the Outlands remain the toughest division to face in GCX. OM 1 - BC 2

The Spectres aren't spending a lot but are putting together wins in what was expected to be a throwaway season for them. What the Sump Runners can do to make this work better is yet to be determined. DS 3 - SR 1

These intradivisional match draws are great for the late season competition for playoff spots but still feel a bit weird in these early days of the season. CF 3 - EF 3

The Hounds are having more issues this season than I'm sure they wanted, while the Tatters made the most of them to keep within striking distance of their division lead. CT 2 - GH 1

**The Gore Farmers pulled off the win to bring the standings tighter, despite an excellent bit of gamesmanship by the Wyrms. Kelemann's TD at the end of the first half is an exquisite bit of work that deserves to be replayed over and over. GF 4 - OW 1** #recap

Humbert tried to win the game all by himself but couldn't stop the Arborists. AR 4 - RE 2

The Dynamo established themselves early on defence and despite muffing one possible TD that could have opened the match up even wider, they didn't panic and didn't rely solely on Sabah. KD 4 - IC 1
