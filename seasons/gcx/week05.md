# Week Five

FT 3 SR 5 - in the division FT happy with Venus but now in last place

BC 4 - EF 5 A burner of barns that hasn't settled the early stage of the Sardines Award between Atte and Aeson (though Sabah has been put on notice for Week 5), but did get the Fatality a much needed win to cycle from the basement of the standings (a place they are not accustomed to). 

AR 3 - KD 4 Sabah didn't make any gains in the Sardines chase, but they did manage to hand the Arborists their second loss in a row (which hasn't happened since the first UBBL Challenge)

RE 1 - GH 2 The Hounds finally gotinto the Win column.

CT 0 - CF 2 The Tatters got too aggressive and it cost them control of the first half. Catchup ios never their strength

ZV 3 - OW 3 A founders' match that turned out a draw. The Wyrms aren't crawling out of the cellar of the Stacks yet, but the fans were happy there weren't any injuries.

OM 2 - IC 1 Dungardin rematch that went the same as the others? #citationneeded

DS 2 - GF 3 The Gore Farmers won another one putting them squarely atop the Stacks, while the Spectres didn't lose too much ground (being easily able to afford replacement players is a luxury many UBBL teams don't have).

Player of the Week Atte with 12 SPP
