# Week Five

FT 3 SR 5 - in the division FT happy with Venus but now in last place

BC 4 - EF 5 A burner of barns that hasn't settled the early stage of the Sardines Award between Atte and Aeson (though Sabah has been put on notice for Week 5), but did get the Fatality a much needed win to cycle from the basement of the standings (a place they are not accustomed to).

AR 3 - KD 4 Sabah didn't make any gains in the Sardines chase, but they did manage to hand the Arborists their second loss in a row (which hasn't happened since the first UBBL Challenge)
