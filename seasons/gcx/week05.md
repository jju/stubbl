## matches to watch

There's a Founders' match this week between the Vagabonds and Wyrms, as well as a bashy playoff rematch between the strangely competitive Spectres and the Gore Farmers who are looking to come out on top of the Stacks.

## recap

While the Tide are happy with the continuing development of Veens, this intradivisional match put them in last place overall, and gained the Sump Runners some momentum. FT 3 - SR 5

A burner of barns that hasn't settled the early stage of the Sardines Award between Atte and Aeson (though Sabah has been put on notice for Week 5), but did get the Fatality a much needed win to cycle from the basement of the standings (a place they are not accustomed to). BC 4 - EF 5

Sabah didn't make any gains in the Sardines chase, but they did manage to hand the Arboreal Menace their second loss in a row (which hasn't happened since the first UBBL Challenge) AR 3 - KD 4

The Hounds finally got into the Win column. RE 1 - GH 2

The Tatters got too aggressive and it cost them control of the first half. Catchup is never their strength. CT 0 - CF 2

A founders' match that turned out a draw. The Wyrms aren't crawling out to glory yet, but the fans were happy there weren't any injuries. ZV 3 - OW 3

A rematch of the Betrayal at Dungardin that pretty much the same as the original. OM 2 - IC 1 #citationneeded

The Gore Farmers won another one putting them squarely atop the Stacks, while the Spectres didn't lose too much ground (being easily able to afford replacement players is a luxury many UBBL teams don't have). DS 2 - GF 3

Player of the Week Atte with 12 SPP

Everyone in the Outlands lost this week, leaving their standings unchanged and really close, while in the Pits, the bottom teams got within a win of the top. The big losers as far as the standings go were the Filthy Tide who are a full win out of third place in the Stacks.
