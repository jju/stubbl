## matches to watch

Rivalry match between the bottom-dwelling Tide and the good Claws could be high scoring, even if the Claws should dominate. It just takes one bad bounce and we'll be off the 16-16 scoring pace. (The record number of TDs in a single UBBL match is 15.) Though the Arborists are faltering a bit they're still favoured to defeat the Glorious Hounds. At this point in the season, I might need to be paid to watch a Kaiju Dynamo match, but some people think they have a shot against the Gore Farmers.
