## matches to watch

Rivalry match between the bottom-dwelling Tide and the good Claws could be high scoring, even if the Claws should dominate. It just takes one bad bounce and we'll be off the 16-16 scoring pace. (The record number of TDs in a single UBBL match is 15.) Though the Arboreal Menace are faltering a bit they're still favoured to defeat the Glorious Hounds. At this point in the season, I might need to be paid to watch a Kaiju Dynamo match, but some people think they have a shot against the Gore Farmers.

## recap

The Tide won the coin-toss and scored. Then the Claws scored, then the Tide, then Consolo messed up a pass, allowing the Tide to score again, going up by 2 (and messing up the possibility of the 16-16 draw). At halftime (after killing Avani and Wilda of the Claws), the Tide remained in the lead 5-4, which put them in the catbird seat with final possession looming. A Badger Claw blitz in the fourth quarter almost evened up the edge, but the Tide calmly got the ball back to Veens to keep control of things. Then Haman botched a pass, and that cost the Claws the chance at the draw, but gave the Tide the opportunity to get a double-digit final score. In all, a massive upset win for the last-place team. FT 10 - BC 8 (BC+) 723.1 

The Sump Runners made sure the Tide's historic win earlier in the round wasn't wasted, by losing their quite pedestrian match. When the Machine abandoned their conservative gameplan, they almost let go of this one, but couldn't. OM 1 - SR 0 (Even) 723.2

Two first-half blitzes helped push the Spectres into a 4-0 halftime lead. They needed every bit of it to maintain the upset as the Fatality did their best to come back and escape the cellar in the second. Atte appears to be out of the Sardines race for the season so the Fatality scoring was spread around a bit better than it has been. DS 4 - EF 3 (EF+) 723.3

The Glorious Hounds did their part to encourage the Arborist skid to the bottom of the Outlands by beating on their fragility and spreading their own scoring around. AR 3 - GH 4 (AR) 723.4

The Cogs took their time warming up, with a 2-2 draw going into halftime, but a blitz after taking the lead got them on track to get the win they expected. CF 2 - IC 4 (IC+) 723.5

The Dynamo's lacklustre lineup showed that they are ready to reinvent themselves this season as a defensive interfering roadblock, now that scoring is going to be more difficult. The Farmers definitely didn't seem prepared for a team that wasn't just going to roll over. GF 0 - KD 2 (Even) 723.6

The Eagles had the chance to take a first half lead, but got greedy in their desire to get a bit more bashing in, allowing the Vagabonds a chance for the sack and strip to convert to a whole-field TD. The Vagabonds had a couple of scares in the end, and the medical team was so focused on keeping Zaira's career alive, Aishath fell by the wayside, but they maintained their top spot in the season. ZV 2 - RE 0 (Even) 723.7

The projections never think the Tatters are going to do well, and sometimes they're right. But not today. The Wyrms tied the match up at halftime and had control, but the relentless physical dominance proved too much for them and they now have a severely depleted lineup going into Week 10. CT 3 - OW 1 (OW) 723.8
