## matches to watch

The Sump Runners require a win against the Vagabonds, who have been slipping. If they get that win, then the Tide will require a win to make the playoffs, but if the Sump Runners lose they're out.

If the Fatality lose to the Arborists (likely) and the Spectres beat the Wyrms (unlikely) the Fatality season is over. A Fatality win keeps the Pits in play to week 16.

A Filthy Tide win in Week 14 or 15 secures their playoff berth, but they would love to move up to second place in the Stacks with a win against the Gore Farmers.

The Hounds are the furthest out from a playoff spot, but they have a head-to-head against the team they need to knock off in the Machine. A loss or draw means the Hounds will be last in the Heaps.

The Old Wyrms practically have their first-round bye sewn up, and facing the relatively weak (but surprising) Spectres this week gives them a chance for a developmental match.

The Badger Claws need a win this week (and more if the Arborists get points) to make the playoffs.

The Dynamo could miss the playoffs if they lose and the Hounds win this week and next. A win or draw secures their postseason berth.

The Cogs and Tatters is a fight for first-place overall and for that Outlands bye, but both of these teams will be in the playoffs anyway so it's mostly pride. We will probably be seeing a rematch for the Outlands division title.

## recap

The Vagabonds played a good effective game putting them back in first place overall (at least for the moment) while the Sump Runners' season is effectively over. The question for them is now how to replace Selma and how effective they can hope to be in the upcoming UBBL Challenge IV. SR 0 - ZV 3

The Arborists put the screws to the Fatality though a surge through the second half almost put a draw within reach. The win also puts pressure on the Badger Claws to win if they want to see the postseason. EF 2 - AR 3

The Machine pulled off a dramatic last-second draw, eliminating the Glorious Hounds from playoff contention. GH 3 - OM 3

The Claws had some issues early but just barely eked out a win, keeping their playoff hopes alive. RE 1 - BC 2
