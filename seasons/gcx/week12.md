## matches to watch

We start off with a last-place battle, but the Sump Runners can make up more ground with a win, especially since match two in the next-to-the-bottom dwellers squaring off. The question of how long the Dynamo can keep their spoiler role going into the playoffs is becoming less and less theoretical.

## recap

The Fatality got closer in the Pits with a SR - EF (EF) 

The Furies tore into the heavily-favoured Arborists and claimed first place in the Pits (at least for the moment) AR 1 - CF 5 (AR+)

A gruelling smasher left the Gore Farmers without a point again. This opens the door for the Wyrms to take a real lead in the Stacks. OM 1 - GF 0 (GF)
