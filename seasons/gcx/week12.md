## matches to watch

We start off with a last-place battle, but the Sump Runners can make up more ground with a win, especially since match two in the next-to-the-bottom dwellers squaring off. The question of how long the Dynamo can keep their spoiler role going into the playoffs is becoming less and less theoretical.

## recap

The Fatality did what they needed to, and are within spitting distance of keeping the Pits within reach, but it depends on the rest of the division to pull ahead if they so desire.
 SR 2 - EF 4 (EF) 

The Tide never got Venus going properly in this match. She ended up with two TDs but bobbled a number of catches that put it out of reach. FT 2 - GH 4

Venus was ecstatic to watch her main rival for the Sardines prize have a scoreless match, and the Cogs made it that much harder for either of the Outlands lower-ranked teams to be able to un crab bucket themselves. BC 0 - IC 4 (BC)

The Furies tore into the heavily-favoured Arboreal Menace and claimed first place in the Pits (at least for the moment) AR 1 - CF 5 (AR+)

A gruelling smasher left the Gore Farmers without a point again. This opens the door for the Wyrms to take a real lead in the Stacks. OM 1 - GF 0 (GF)

The Tatters reasserted themselves to stay ahead of the Cogs, who've been projected as winners from very early on. DS 1 - CT 3

The Wyrms came very close to getting the win, but the Eagles just managed enough trips and slowdowns to keep the draw. RE 2 - OW 2

The Dynamo are really stepping into their spoiler role with a pivotal divisional win against the leaderboard Vagabonds. If the Vagabonds fade down the stretch, this match will be the one historians point to. ZV 1 - KD 2 (ZV)
