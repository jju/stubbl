## matches to watch

We get to see the new-look offense of the Glorious Hounds right off the bat in a battle of last-place teams trying to make the playoffs. The Arboreal Menace need to pull the division back into reach, but have a hard row to hoe against the Tatters.

## recap

The Fatality got their win and kept Ziba from affecting the outcome too badly, so the Hounds are quite disappointed, and have given their Heaps competitors breathing room to expand their leads. EF 5 - GH 3 (EF) 725.2

The Arboreal Menace got their win, keeping the Outlands tight and by far the best division in the tournament. CT 1 - AR 2 (Even) 725.3

Another first vs last place battle, but this one was won by the favourite. OW - SR (OW+) 725.4

The Tide were coming off two big wins, but Venus stumbled badly (twice in the first half when holding the ball to score) before getting it together in the second. But by then they were down by two and needed big efforts on defence, which they did not get.  FT 3 - DS 5

The FuriesCF 3 - OM 1

The Vagabonds were actually pegged to win this match, which hasn't happened a lot in this season, but they just couldn't match up against the Gore Farmers' physicality. GF 4 - ZV 0 (ZV) 725.7

KD - BC (BC+) 725.8

The Cogs gave up a match they could have had, but not because of lacklustre play. It was a tight match that they didn't give away and possibly could have turned it around in the end. But they didn't. The Eagles hung onto first in the Pits because of it. IC 1 - RE 2 (IC) 725.9
