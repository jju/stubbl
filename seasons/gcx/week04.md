## matches to watch

It's sort of a down week in the schedule, with only the Arboreal Menace vs Badger Claws set for any real drama ahead of time.

# recap

This week saw the scoring race really heat up with a new three-way tie for first place between [[atte]] [[sabah]] and [[aeson]] at 7 TDs apiece with [[costache]] right behind at 6. Player of the Week was the young upstart [[venus]] with 14 SPP.

Both teams seem to be satisfied with the single point in a mostly blizzard-fuelled matchup. ZV 2 - OM 2

The Badger Claws scored on defense and kept Aeson sprinting down the field to collect TDs, which ended up being a bit too much for the Arboreal Menace, who hadn't ever faced that kind of offensive onslaught. BC 5 - AR 3

Spectres' star Tooms II was killed in the opening drive of their match and the Spectres never really recovered. That was more like how we expected their season to go. RE 2 - DS 0

**Not as high-scoring as it could have been but the dramatic turns in the dying moments put a lot of pressure on Sabah and the Dynamo to escape with the tie. OW 3 - KD 3**

The Cogs used the blizzard to keep the inexperienced Venus out of the endzone to tie up the match in the dying moments. FT 3 - IC 4 #drama

Perfectly executed first half defense set up a slightly looser second for the Tatters. The Runners were sorely missing some pop. SR 0 - CT 1

An excellent match and again, the Fatality scored a bit too quick and their aggression couldn't force a turnover in the dying moments. EF 3 - GF 4

A beautiful last-second play stole victory from the Hounds. GH 2 - CF 2 #drama

## standings

| Stacks |  | Outlands |  | Heaps |  | Pits |  |
|-------|-----|--|--|------|------|--|--|
| Gore Farmers | 6 | Carcosan Tatters | 10 | Zensun Vagabonds | 7 | Ravenous Eagles | 7 |
| Old Wyrms | 5 | Arboreal Menace | 9 | Orbital Machine | 5 | Darkling Spectres | 7 |
| Filthy Tide | 3 | Badger Claws | 9 | Kaiju Dynamo | 4 | Cackling Furies | 3 |
| TC Sump Runners | 3 | Irregular Cogs | 6 | Glorious Hounds | 2 | Eldritch Fatality | 2 |

The Stacks are not going according to plan, especially not for the defending GCIX champions, but it's all pretty tight.

The Badger Claws drew first blood on the Arboreal Menace, this week, giving the Tatters the division lead in the league's toughest grouping.

The Hounds have been struggling to make a move, especially worrying since they were hoping for a breakthrough season. The Vagabonds and Machine drew their match this week, which they both might regret if [[sabah]] continues to heat up and push the Dynamo up the win column.

The Pits have the most separation between the good teams and the less-so. That those groups are precisely inverted from what was expected in the preseason is surprising, but Eagles fans will take it.
