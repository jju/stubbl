* player storyline  GH-SR [[warreporter]] Ziba needs a big game since Venus will be going against a defense-free Claws squad, IC-DS [[writer]] who are the stars and who's been getting these teams through?, FT-BC [[aficionado]] offense offense offense do these games get a little unpredictable?
* team storyline GF-CF [[writer]] poetry of bashing, OM-ZV [[aficionado]] OM don't even have a path to a full roster in the playoffs so will they just roll over and let [[Uli]] build the Carmine Fist lead, RE-EF [[warreporter]] second vs first so a likely playoff preview

Ziba took over the Sardines lead against the Sump Runners and the Hounds took over the lead in the Heaps division. Will either of those leads last the week? GH 6 - SR 2 [[gcxi-12-ghsr]]

The Machine got a draw out of this match with a bunch of scrubs getting some exercise, while the injuries to the Vagabonds look like they will be manageable for their playoff hopes. OM 1 - ZV 1 [[gcxi-12-omzv]]

[[Danr]] had a career game as the rest of the furies fell before the bashy might of the Farmers. Losing [[sophronia]] will be the hardest part going forward as they don't have a backup waiting in the wings. GF 1 - CF 2 [[gcxi-12-gfcf]]

A surprisingly decisive victory for the Spectres against a team trying to win a division. That they stole [[alexandros]]' contract in the middle of it all adds insult to injury. IC 0 - DS 3 [[gcxi-12-icds]]

The Tide held on through Aleksy's passing difficulties and clinched first in the Stacks and Venus retook the TD lead. FT 9 - BC 7 [[gcxi-12-ftbc]]

The Tatters did a patented smother and control match and put a lot of pressure on the Badger Claws to right their ship if they want to give their speedstaers a taste of playoff action. OW 0 - CT 2 [[gcxi-12-owct]]

The Fatality had a nice little romp and Percy got a couple more casualties under his belt in the hopes the Eagles will be playing in the post-season (which is now slightly in doubt). RE 0 - EF 3 [[gcxi-12-reef]]

The Menace spread the ball around and absolutely dismantled the Dynamo without even getting their fastest offensive threat a TD. KD 0 - AM 6 [[gcxi-12-kdam]]
