#t2786

With two weeks left there are important races going in three divisions.

* business storyline: [[warreporter]], *CT-DS* [[aficionado]] both embracing the just enough approach, GF-SR [[writer]] it doesn't matter at all so SHucker gave Green Cup playing time to a bunch of rookies.
* player storyline  GH-OM [[warreporter]] with Venus on an off-week Ziba could gain some Sardines ground here, *IC-GF* [[writer]] who are the stars and who's been getting these teams through?, RE-FT [[aficionado]] Venus has her big lead in the Sardines race and the team has clinched but she's insisting on taking the field against a dangerous team
* team storyline *SR-KD* [[writer]] two almost lost causes one with more hope than the other, *AM-OW* [[aficionado]] Wyrms can't catch a bye but a loss leaves things more up in the air than they want, *EF-OM* [[warreporter]] Fatality have to bounce back and figure out a way without muscle while the Machine solely has muscle
* Playoffs: Intradivisional: GF-SR but it doesn't matter at all, GH-OM could get the Machine out of the basement if the Vagabonds lose earlier, IC-CT Tatters win could put them in play for the division title.

The Runners might be able to play spoilers against the Spectres in Week 15 but this match's loss to the Farmers' nobodies was entirely meaningless. GF 2 - SR 1 [[gcxi-14-gfsr]]

The Vagabonds' Zaira's botched handoff to Green stalled an amazing looking first half, but the Wyrms couldn't connect downfield and Betuel brought it back with Padma to take a 1-0 lead into halftime. They bashed their way through the Wyrms' line while regaining the lead and ended up clinching their playoff spot. OW 2 - ZV 3 [[gcxi-14-owzv]]

The Eagles beat the Tide which they needed to have a chance at the playoffs, and the Tide kept the injuries manageable for their upcoming Week 15 with the recovery of the Bye week after that. RE 2 - FT 1 [[gcxi-14-reft]]

The Machine spent the first half falttening everyone on the field (and got a TD and the lead), winnowing the Hounds down to 6 for the second half. Unfortunately for them Ziba was one of the 6 and promptly scored off the kick to open the second. That proved enough to hang onto the draw and eliminate the Machine from the GCXI playoffs. GH 1 - OM 1 [[gcxi-14-ghom]]

The Badger Claws couldn't get it together to pull off a win and they have missed the playoffs for the first time since entering Green Cup level play. The Spectres have clinched nothing but do have the edge in Week 15.  DS 3 - BC 3 [[gcxi-14-dsbc]]

The Tatters picked up the win that could put them in the mix for the Division title (with a few more losses by the Menace and Cogs) but the big news is how [[Merlyn]] died tripping over himself trying to stop the Tatters from taking a 2-0 lead into halftime. It didn't work and that puts the Cogs' postseason hopes to bed even if they get the Division title. IC 1 - CT 2 [[gcxi-14-icct]]

The Menace handily picked apart the Furies and made it through uninjured for the final week of the season. Now the Furies need a win to avoid the relegation danger. CF 1 - AM 3 [[gcxi-14-cfam]]

The Dynamo managed the match well, especially in the second half after whittling down the Fatality players. It was a bit of a boring one and hopefully if these teams do rematch in the Conference Finals we get more fireworks. KD 3 - EF 2 [[gcxi-14-kdef]]
