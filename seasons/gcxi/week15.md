#t2787

We enter the final week with all the storylines wrapped up but a bunch of different playoff scenarios to deal with:

The first two matches will have no impact on the postseason. The Claws have been eliminated and the Wyrms cannot catch the division title. This is likely to be [[Aeson]]'s final match so it has that going for it. The Machine and Tide are a battle of eliminated vs clinched division title, but there is the intrigue of the Casualty and TD title leaders going head to head. If the Tide suffer casualties that could be a real blow.

The Sump Runners have been eliminated but a win for the Spectres clinches a playoff spot. They don't *need* the win if either of the Eagles or Furies lose, but a win makes what anyone else does moot.

The Dynamo need a win or draw to put pressure on the Hounds to match them or surrender the Division title. If they lose they'll be having a rematch against the Vagabonds next week so it's hard to say what kind of look the Vagabonds want to be giving them. at their tricks.

The Farmers are running out a lineup of rookies against a Menace team that clinches the division with a win. That would take some of the air out of the Cogs' match later in the week.

The Tatters don't really care about the win but a Furies' win makes the Pits more volatile again, putting pressure on the Eagles to win or else.

The Fatality vs Hounds is a possible Conference Final preview (didn't the Fatality just do one of these?) and the Hounds probably want the win more, but the Fatality haven't beaten the next-best teams much this season so there is a bit of pride on the line.

The Eagles and Cogs could have their fates decided before playing, but if it's still up in the air this'll be a huge match.

The Tide defeated the Machine, as expected, but [[Venus]] was seriously injured and her effectiveness moving forward seems in doubt. OM 2 - FT 3 [[gcxi-15-omft]]

Despite being eliminated the Badger Claws put on a great show for Aeson's final outing in the blue and green and the Wyrms' medical staff kept everyone ready for their playoff date with the Gore Farmers. BC 7 - OW 2 [[gcxi-15-bcow]]

That the Sump Runners have never beaten the Spectres is a little interesting. This match showed the Spectres at their best with their mix of bash and dash that should do well in the playoffs, having now clinched the second seed in the Pits. SR 1 - DS 3 [[gcxi-15-srds]]

These two teams have a long history with the Dynamo's sole loss being in the GCX Division Finals. The Vagabonds didn't really care about overturning that record this match as long as it holds they meet up in the GCXI playoffs. The lineups look to be quite different in a week or two. ZV 1 - KD 2 [[gcxi-15-zvkd]]

Going into halftime the Menace were only up 1-0, which wasn't at all what anyone expected. But both teams settled into their expected roles in the second half and balance was restored. AM 3 - GF 2 [[gcxi-15-amgf]]
