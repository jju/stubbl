It is crazy that spreadZone were giving odds in favour of the Spectres winning this match. No seriously, what are you thinking? Give the Gore Farmers credit though, they fielded a strong lineup. You could barely tell who was who in the Spectres' half of the field. DS 1 - GF 2 [[gcxi-01-dsgf]]

The Claws had the edge going in against a Fatality team that was terrible last season and has no resources to build up something much better this season unless they win a lot of games. [[Rong]] got badly hurt on the opening drive which can't be good for their development plans. At the half Rong had been joined by a chunk of the line fodder on the sidelines and the Fatality were up 2-1. They never released that lead. EF 4 - BC 2 [[gcxi-01-efbc]] 

How will the bad teams do in GCXI? The Machine are kind of a dark horse for the season, but the Sump Runners are probably going to be terrible. This match was injury-filled, but in the end the Machine tied it up, which the Sump Runners aren't too unhappy with. OM 2 - SR 2 [[gcxi-01-omsr]]

The Hounds were coming off a tournament win and were looking to show off against one of their arch-rivals, but a muffed pass set the tone early and the Tatters pulled the match down to their level. GH 2 - CT 2 [[gcxi-01-ghct]]

The Filthy Tide haven't quite become a support band for [[Veens]], yet. SpreadZone gave the Menace the edge in this battle of speed, but [[Septimus]] managed to rescue the win for the Tide FT 6 - AM 5 [[gcxi-01-ftam]]

Note that spreadZone was wrong on everything so far except the Sump Runners and Machine being too close to call.

The Cogs got their first win even though the Dynamo seemed pretty ready for their tricks. KD 1 - IC 2 [[gcxi-01-kdic]]

Eagles upset the Vagabonds but didn't do enough damage in the casualty list to be able to tell what their Iron Fist results might be. RE 2 - ZV 0 [[gcxi-01-rezv]]

The Old Wyrms are prohibitive favourites on the season. Can they be even more dominant than they were in GCIX? Not according to this match! The Furies kept the Wyrms under control and got a draw, which is way more than they were expected. The Wyrms can't be happy with that. OW 2 - CF 2 [[gcxi-01-owcf]]
