The Hounds showed that they should not be counted out any more than the Fatality this season by destroying the Vagabonds. GH 6 - ZV 1 [[gcxi-08-ghzv]]

The Wyrms got a draw that felt as bad as a loss against their divisional punching-bag Sump Runners. OW 3 - SR 3 [[gcxi-08-owsr]]

The Spectres scored a major upset that hinged on an early perfect defensive alignment to throw off the Menace's quick scoring gameplan. DS 6 - AM 4 [[gcxi-08-dsam]]

The Uli vs Jantine showdown went to Uli, who knocked out the Eagles' star (after a brief scare that Jantine may have died), but the Eagles got the win. RE 1 - OM 0 [[gcxi-08-reom]]

The Gore Farmers took advantage of sloppy play by the Tatters in the first half and pressed their advantage in the second. Long-term the effects of losing Tycho in this game will be the most deeply felt. GF 1 - CT 0 [[gcxi-08-gfct]]

The Cogs dispatched the Furies with little emotion, their defense scoring three of their TDs. CF 2 - IC 5 [[gcxi-08-cfic]]

A bit of a weird one for the Claws who didn't really get the chance to develop Klim the way he's going to need to be a reliable threat in the postseason (assuming they get that far). KD 3 - BC 2 [[gcxi-08-kdbc]]

The Tide got the ball to Veens 4 times and handed the Fatality their first loss of the season in an exciting match that could be the preview of the GCXI championship. FT 6 - EF 4 [[gcxi-08-ftef]]
