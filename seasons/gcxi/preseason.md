The roster rules have changed again in GCXI. There is no Value Cap after the strict 1500 TV tried out in the Orange Goblet II, which led to unhappy fans and players. There is a Value Floor in the Green Cup of 1700 and players' contracts are now able to be traded between teams.

| Burger Conference | | Classic Conference | |
|---------------------|--|------------|----|
| *Stacks* | *Outlands* | *Heaps* | *Pits* |
| Old Wyrms | Badger Claws | Glorious Hounds | Eldritch Fatality |
| **Filthy Tide** | Irregular Cogs | Kaiju Dynamo | **Ravenous Eagles** |
| **Gore Farmers** | Arboreal Menace | **Zensun Vagabonds** | **Cackling Furies** |
| TC Sump Runners | Carcosan Tatters | **Orbital Machine** | Darkling Spectres |

Other projection systems (which usually don't do as well before the season) flipped the order of some of these finishes (bolded in the above table), but the general consensus is that the Old Wyrms are in a good position to defend their championship, the Burger Conference will again be the stronger one, and the Darkling Spectres will be bad.
