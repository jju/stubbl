The roster rules have changed again in GCXI. There is no Value Cap after the strict 1500 TV tried out in the Orange Goblet II, which led to unhappy fans and players. There is a Value Floor in the Green Cup of 1700 and players' contracts are now able to be purchased and traded between teams.

The Green Cup playoffs are sticking with their attritional roster model, where the 16 players selected for the playoffs are the only ones allowed to the team for the run, no substitutions. That playoff 16 also has to have been under contract for the final five rounds of the regular season (no signing a star just for the playoffs).

The other minor change is due to the quick nature of Orange Goblet II and the desire to have an OGIII tournament running concurrently with the Green Cup. This season there is a minor status prize for the top three teams after Week 5 - a date with the top teams from Orange Goblet II in the Champions Circuit. So a hot start could be beneficial for team prestige at least.

Here's what the standings could look like by the end of the regular season. One ranking is a theoretical W-D-L total for the regular season based on past results. The second is an overall ranking (across divisions and conferences) based on recent performance and past scoring/defence metrics and the strength of the current lineup.
