* business storyline FT-DS [[aficionado]] the logic of the tank vs a team really trying to win, RE-KD [[writer]] those new players just sitting there waiting (with the prize money from the CC at stake the Eagles really would like to get in), GF-OM [[warreporter]] the rivalry behind the ownership groups (aficionados vs pragmatist gangsetrs) and how it plays out on the field,  
* player storyline CT-BC [[writer]] Aeson's continued return and how the partnership with Klim plays out especially after a lacklustre performance in Week 4, CF-EF [[aficionado]] new rookie Koralo, RE-KD [[warreporter]] injuries from Jantine
* team storyline OW-GH [[writer]] can the Hounds swagger match up with their results, GF-OM [[warreporter]] Farmers had a bad match against a bashing team maybe they can turn it around? [[aficionado]] Tatters bouncing back and can they stop the intense run again? [[aficionado]] IC-ZV another throwback rivalry O8 matchup
* Champions Circuit: The Fatality have a lock on facing the Raptors in the Champions Circuit and the team they are facing is merely trying to stay out of the division's basement so CF-EF has no standings interest. The Hounds can clinch second place with a win against the Wyrms regardless of the rest of the matches (they can also sneak in with a loss if there are a flurry of ties. KD AM and GF could possibly get into the CC with a win (the AM are playing the SR so this should almost be a guarantee), but they would require losses from the RE FT and IC. KD has the best shot at this since they are playing the Eagles, and the IC have the toughest opponents in the ZV, but if the AM win the KD are mostly out of luck.

The Menace got the win they needed, but never really ran away with the match until the bitter end. AM 5 - SR 3 [[gcxi-05-amsr]]

The Tide romped through the Spectres even with a down match from Venus. DS 0 - FT 4 [[gcxi-05-dsft]]

The Tatters couldn't quite manage to keep the Claws out of the endzone enough to make a difference. CT 2 - BC 3 [[gcxi-05-ctbc]]

The Fatality had a nice easy game collecting their fifth win and keeping things close while the Furies got some reps with their rookies in the snow. CF 1 - EF 2 [[gcxi-05-cfef]]

The Gore Farmers never had a lead in this match, but they scrambled their asses off to get the draw when the snow stopped. GF 2 - OM 2 [[gcxi-05-gfom]]

The freebooters weren't helpful but the Vagabonds got the development they needed, while the Cogs did their best to claim a Champions Circuit berth. IC 5 - ZV 1 [[gcxi-05-iczv]]

What a disappointment for the Hounds. The Wyrms were going in without an immediate need for the win and were using a depleted lineup. A muffed catch and a botched pickup were enough to cough up a defeat. OW 5 - GH 4 [[gcxi-05-owgh]]

The Dynamo had solid play from everyone and kept the underskilled Eagles from getting a cage truly set up. They grabbed fourth place in the Green Cup 1/3 of the way through, which was not quite enough to make the Champions Circuit. RE 0 - KD 4 [[gcxi-05-rekd]]
