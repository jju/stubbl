The last-place teams met and the Vagabonds proved that the "go cheap" technique doesn't work for everyone. The Badger Claws will be making some lineup changes for Week 3. BC 2 - ZV 5 [[gcxi-02-bczv]]

The Furies came out swinging and though the Dynamo pressured early with a blitzing effort they managed to score. The Dynamo used the rest of the half to even it up and then made an end to end to end effort to pull off the win. CF 1 - KD 2 [[gcxi-02-cfkd]]

SpreadZone was picking the Menace as heavy favourites and it seems they knew something about [[laurel]] who had a breakout match. AM 4 - OM 2 [[gcxi-02-amom]]

The Spectres pulled off a win against the (weridly only slightly favoured) Eagles. RE 1 - DS 2 [[gcxi-02-reds]]

The Fatality continue to show that GCX was a fluke. SR 1 - EF 4 [[gcxi-02-sref]]

In the Stacks the Farmers are glad to have gotten this match over with, as this week the Wyrms looked like the unstoppable defending champions they weren't in Week 1. GF 1 - OW 5 [[gcxi-02-gfow]]

The Cogs looked off in Week 2 or maybe the Hounds had just recovered their pennant-winning swagger. IC 1 - GH 3 [[gcxi-02-icgh]]

The Tide could only keep up with the Wyrms instead of growing an advantage, while the Tatters have to feel lucky to be keeping the speedsters at bay so far this campaign. CT 2 - FT 2 [[gcxi-02-ctft]]
