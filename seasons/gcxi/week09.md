The Menace managed to put their Week 8 debacle behind them, but [[Laurel]] gained no ground in the Sardines Crown race. AM 3 - ZV 2 [[gcxi-09-amzv]]

That this draw wasn't devastating to the Claws speaks more to their lowered expectations as the season goes on. SR 2 - BC 2 [[gcxi-09-srbc]]

The Cogs kept the pressure on and the Machine remain a long way back in the Heaps. IC 3 - OM 1 [[gcxi-09-icom]]

The Fatality had to work for it, but the win against a usually excellent defensive team bodes well for their eventual playoff longevity. CT 1 - EF 2 [[gcxi-09-ctef]]

[[Venus]] didn't have a record-breaking match but comfortably stayed in the mix for the Sardines Crown while the rest of the team fought off injury and got the win to stay in second place overall. CF 1 - FT 4 [[gcxi-09-cfft]]

The Hired Gun Hemlock took out [[Olufunmi]] one of the Spectres' biggest stars early and then they proceeded to hang onto the ball through the first half and applied tactical pressure in the sloppy conditions of the second for a big Dynamo win. DS 0 - KD 3 [[gcxi-09-dskd]]

The Wyrms got an identical result to the Tenth Green Cup final which they needed if they are going to make a similar playoff run in GCXI. RE 1 - OW 2 [[gcxi-09-reow]]

The Farmers performed a masterclass in containment, keeping [[Ziba]] off the scoreboard and stayed ahead of the Wyrms in the Stacks. GF 3 - GH 0 [[gcxi-09-gfgh]]
