The Dynamo handled the hapless Sump Runners easily and now await the result of the expected scorefest between the Hounds and Claws to see if they're going to reclaim their division lead. SR 0 - KD 2 [[gcxi-13-srkd]]

The Fatality got another win that's sort of meaningless as the Machine spent the match smashing for Uli's prize. EF 2 - OM 0 [[gcxi-13-efom]]

Venus touched the ball 8 times and scored on 7 of those possessions. Opposing teams need to get in the way of that pipeline. This loss technically kept the Machine in the running for a playoff spot. ZV 0 - FT 7 [[gcxi-13-zvft]]

For a touch of extra reliability the Claws pulled Aeson back into service for this match, giving Klim the game off. It turned out not to matter as the Hounds' defense stopped him from getting the ball at crucial moments which achieved the win and may have put the nail in the coffin of the Claws' season. BC 7 - GH 8 [[gcxi-13-bcgh]]

The Wyrms clinched a playoff spot with a gutsy win in a back-and-forth match. AM 3 - OW 4 [[gcxi-13-amow]]

The Furies laid down some serious beating to gain a bit of an edge on the playoff spot while the Eagles will now have an uphill battle to defend their conference title from GCX. CF 3 - RE 0 [[gcxi-13-cfre]]

Sparrow and Arya made a nice connection in the beginning of the second half (after a messy clumsy first for both sides), but the Spectres responded in the adverse conditions to take the win and the advantage in the Pits. CT 1 - DS 2 [[gcxi-13-ctds]]
