The Value Floor introduced in GCXI was deemed a success and will continue in GCXII. The big change is the expansion of the league, where some of the top Open Division teams will be vying for Pro series wins. The previous winners of Orange Goblets have been granted charters for Pro-level teams, along with the Palace Orchids (previously named the Gladiolas), who have the second-most Open wins. The last open slot will be for the winner of UBBL Challenge V, unless that winner is already a Pro team. Then it will come down to a choice between the Deep Dreamers (next most UBBL Ws behind Gladiolas, next most FF, next most cash), Vanadium Hunters (more UBBL wins with old-era and pre-relegation included, next most team value) or Thorns (next most Win%). There is going to be a 500K fee required from the new teams which will be redistributed to the existing pro teams at 125K each.

Surprisingly after their 1-1-8 Orange Goblet III season, the [[xenothrillers]] got the fourth expansion slot, joining the Outlands division (with the [[arborealmenace]] who they defeated).

Despite 20 teams, the Green Cup will stick with 15 matches per team, each one only facing an oppositely ranked team in one cross-conference division. This will make for more bye-weeks through the season, which the players seem happy with.

The Orange Goblet will be running later than in GCXI so there won't be a midseason Champions Circuit match.

The Green Cup playoffs are sticking with their attritional roster model, where the 16 players selected for the playoffs are the only ones allowed to the team for the run, no substitutions. That playoff 16 also has to have been under contract for at least five rounds of the regular season (no signing a star just for the playoffs).

The other playoff difference will be the introduction of Round of 16 crossover teams. First place in each division will still get a bye (plus a 1-0 win against the last-place team in their division which, yes does skew overall win totals, but them's the breaks). Second place in each division will host the R16 game, but those matches will be against the two next-best teams in the conference, so a strong 4th place team will get into the playoffs in the other division. If a 4th place team beats the second and first seed in the crossover division they get the Division Champion title.

Here's what the standings could look like by the end of the regular season. ~~One ranking is a theoretical W-D-L total for the regular season based on past results. The second is an overall ranking (across divisions and conferences) based on recent performance and past scoring/defence metrics and the strength of the current lineup.~~

## Burger Conference

### Stacks

* VR 6 / 7-2-6 / 11
* FT 7 / 7-0-8 / 8
* OW 12 / 7-0-8 / 1
* GF 18 / 5-1-9 / 18
* SR(VH) 20 / 4-2-9 / 13

Spreadzone doesn't see the generalized predictions the same way, going head to head. That puts the [[oldwyrms]] on top with the [[vanadiumhunters]] battling the [[virtuaraptors]] for a playoff spot.

### Outlands

* IC 4 / 8-0-7 / 8
* CT 9 / 7-1-7 / 14
* AR 10 / 7-0-8 / 2
* BC 13 / 7-0-8 / 2
* XT 16 / 5-1-9 / 19

Spreadzone sees the offnses of the [[arborealmenace]] and [[badgerclaws]] as too much for the [[irregularcogs]] and [[carcosantatters]] to overcome (but no one expects much from the [[xenothrillers]])

## Classic Conference

### Heaps

* KM 2 / 9-0-6 / 12
* GH 3 / 8-0-7 / 5
* KD 8 / 7-1-7 / 4
* ZV 14 / 6-1-8 / 7
* OM 19 / 5-2-8 / 20

Spreadzone hates defence, but surprisingly thinks the [[kaijudynamo]] could win the division.

### Pits

* PO 1 / 10-0-5 / 8
* EF 5 / 7-2-6 / 5
* CF 11 / 7-1-8 / 14
* RE 15 / 5-2-8 / 16
* DS 17 / 5-1-9 / 17

Spreadzone sees the [[eldritchfatality]] as the winners in the Pits, with the [[palaceorchids]] fighting to second place (and the best of the expansion teams).
