The Value Floor introduced in GCXI was deemed a success and will continue in GCXII. The big change is the expansion of the league, where some of the top Open Division teams will be vying for Pro series wins. The previous winners of Orange Goblets have been granted charters for Pro-level teams, along with the Gladiolas, who have the second-most Open wins. The last open slot will be for the winner of UBBL Challenge V, unless that winner is already a Pro team. Then it will come down to a choice between the Deep Dreamers (next most UBBL Ws behind Gladiolas), Vanadium Hunters (more UBBL wins with old-era and pre-relegation included) or Thorns (next most Win%).


The Green Cup playoffs are sticking with their attritional roster model, where the 16 players selected for the playoffs are the only ones allowed to the team for the run, no substitutions. That playoff 16 also has to have been under contract for the final five rounds of the regular season (no signing a star just for the playoffs).

The Orange Goblet will be running later than in GCXI so there won't be a midseason Champions Circuit match.

Here's what the standings could look like by the end of the regular season. One ranking is a theoretical W-D-L total for the regular season based on past results. The second is an overall ranking (across divisions and conferences) based on recent performance and past scoring/defence metrics and the strength of the current lineup.
