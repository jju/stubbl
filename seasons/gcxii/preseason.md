The Value Floor introduced in GCXI was deemed a success and will continue in GCXII. The big change is the expansion of the league, where some of the top Open Division teams will be vying for Pro series wins. The previous winners of Orange Goblets have been granted charters for Pro-level teams, along with the Palace Orchids (previously named the Gladiolas), who have the second-most Open wins. The last open slot will be for the winner of UBBL Challenge V, unless that winner is already a Pro team. Then it will come down to a choice between the Deep Dreamers (next most UBBL Ws behind Gladiolas, next most FF, next most cash), Vanadium Hunters (more UBBL wins with old-era and pre-relegation included, next most team value) or Thorns (next most Win%). There is going to be a 500K fee required from the new teams which will be redistributed to the existing pro teams at 125K each.

The Orange Goblet will be running later than in GCXI so there won't be a midseason Champions Circuit match.

The Green Cup playoffs are sticking with their attritional roster model, where the 16 players selected for the playoffs are the only ones allowed to the team for the run, no substitutions. That playoff 16 also has to have been under contract for at least five rounds of the regular season (no signing a star just for the playoffs).

The other playoff difference will be the introduction of Round of 16 crossover teams. First place in each division will still get a bye (plus a 1-0 win against the last-place team in their division which, yes does skew overall win totals, but them's the breaks). Second place in each division will host the R16 game, but those atches will be against the two next-best teams in the conference, so a strong 4th place team will get into the playoffs in the other division. If a 4th place team beats the second and first seed in the crossover division they get the Division Champion title.

Here's what the standings could look like by the end of the regular season. ~~One ranking is a theoretical W-D-L total for the regular season based on past results. The second is an overall ranking (across divisions and conferences) based on recent performance and past scoring/defence metrics and the strength of the current lineup.~~
