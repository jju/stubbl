The only Green Cup champion remaining in this tournament were the Orbital Machine, while the winners of UBBL Challenge III (Arboreal Menace) was also still around.

The weirdest outcome of the round was a 2-2 Draw for the Cogs and Dynamo. The Cogs had the better record in Pool Play and the Dynamo leadership didn't care to contest it in overtime.

The Arboreal Menace are looking like the class of the tournament with a 3-2 win over another talented team.

Other winners: The [[newcursed | New Cursed]], [[xenothrillers]], [[deepdreamers]], [[badgerclaws]], [[zensunvagabonds | Zensun Vagabonds]], and [[warthogs]].
