The only Green Cup champion remaining in this tournament is the Carcosan Tatters, while the winners of UBBL Challenges I (Filthy Tide) and III (Arboreal Menace) are also still around.

The Warthogs made easy work of the Tatters.

The Glorious Hounds knocked out the New Cursed in some real winning-type effort.

The Arboreal Menace laid down a 6-0 smack on the Deep Dreamers and Georgina got 2 Interceptions to take over the Interception leader position in the overall UBBL. (Most are in the Open Division.)

The first big upset of the Round of 16 came with the Raptors squeaking out a 2-1 victory over the Filthy Tide.

The Fatality had a good redemption match to beat the Spectres.

The TC Sump Runners extinguished their fear of Wary Eagle teams by convincingly defeating the Carrion Pickers.
