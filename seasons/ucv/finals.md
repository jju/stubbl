Arboreal Menace - Thrillers

The Thrillers made it back to the UC final and this time they managed to hold off the scoring prowess of their vastly more skilled opponent to take the pennant.

The battle for the fifth UBBL Pennant was a close one, though not as free-wheeling as some fans might have preferred. Laurel opened the scoring blazingly quickly but the Thrillers had a game plan, to slow everything down. This plan was helped along by a rock that hit [[Ingeborg]], not only taking her out of the game, but ending her career as a thrower. 

The second half saw the Thrillers inflict as many casualties as possible, but most of them ended up being touch and go if the players would return. They scored with only a tiny sliver of time left on the clock, but that still gave the Menace (and Laurel) a tiny wedge to tie things up. [[Geretrudis]] made a win-saving interception and the Thrillers won the UBBL Pennant (and a spot in Green Cup XII).
