Deep Dreamers - New Cursed
Thrillers -	Badger Claws
Arboreal Menace - Warthogs
Zensun Vagabonds - Stripped Cogs

The Cogs continued their surprising run with a 3-1 victory.

The Menace handily dismantled the Warthogs 5-2.

The New Cursed managed to shut out the Deep Dreamers, who really wanted to cement a tournament win to legitimize their claim for Green Cup promotion.

The Thrillers defeated the second-last Green Cup team (decidedly not at full strength) and could possibly get the wild-card Green Cup slot.
