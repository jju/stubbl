# history of the BRL

## caveat

I can't claim anything like being on the ground floor of the development of the BRL. For a lot of my readers that might be enough to discount this piece of work. I understand that. There is an wuthenticity of information that comes from being immersed in the creation of something, of the actual work day in and day out to create something where there was nothing.

But I argue with my skeptical aggressive readers who hate everything a person might try to create. I am a fool that way I suppose.

The approach we're taking here is that of a fairly clear-eyed nonpartisan, I hope. I do know it can't be. When I was writing up the gangwars of Stacksburg people accused me of being anti-religious and not sensitive enough to the plights of the anti-civilization renegades we have in these parts. Even using the term renegades is implying an allegiance with the staus quo. I understand that. But this is the language I have and that I can use. There are greater forces at work in the up above and I know that writing about them through the lens of sport is going to trivialize everything I try to put down, this is what I am trying.

Anon, this direct authorial intervention grows tiresome I am sure.

## CBL

Up above, the Colonial Bludbol League [CBL] is the only version of the sport that matters. There are junior leagues and educational leagues but those are primarily focused on funneling the most talented players into the CBL. I admit I haven't spent a huge amount of time above, but the impression we get down here is that everything that is not the CBL is a mediocre facsimile.

In the CBL there are very impressive stadiums and fans and huge amounts of money are made every year. The amount of control exerted on the players is immense because of the value each franchise commands. Scandals erupt when a player isn't exactly "on message" through the offseason, and that message is one of hyper-aggression and obsession with competition. CBL players are expected to identify wholly with their team. There are no trades, only firings. Once a player is done in the CBL they are blackballed from playing with anyone ever again. Hence the development of the minor leagues.

## cast-off leagues

There are leagues where players who've retired can make their money. Part of the scandal of CBL Bludbol is that since there is such a premium placed on channelling only the best up and up to the pinnacle of the sport the players who end up falling short are left out of much of the rest of society. Their education hasn't been developed to the same degree as their peers.

The cast-off leagues are always seen as a lesser version of the CBL sport. Some of them have modified rulesets that are more or less forgiving for players and their weaknesses that knocked them out of the pinnacle ranks of the sport. The player-friendly leagues have different equipment types
