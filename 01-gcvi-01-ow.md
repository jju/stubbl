So you settle into the EDS to watch the {$followingTeam} play some bludbol. Their first match is against the Gore Farmers.

The game goes slower than you expected, and it's really hard to tell exactly what's going on. It looks like the feeds are just security footage from cameras suspended at weird angles over the field. Everything is washed out and blurry or overblown when the players end up just under a light. 

There were a lot of messy scrums and it looked like the ball was out on the ground a lot, maybe because of missed passes? Without any explanation on the screen and barely any sound, the whole thing was weirdly unsatisfying.

In the end the {$followingTeam} lost 2-1, though you had to look it up on the message boards afterwards.

It sounds like these are going to be the most interesting players to watch, or at least the ones the message-boarders are most excited about.

* [[evander]] - Thrower
* [[Moirin]] - Catcher
* [[Pesci]] - Old-Era Veteran Catcher
* [[Souta]] - Catcher

So that was a week of bludbol. The {$followingTeam} are 0-0-1. What now?

You watch 6 more weeks of terrible video-quality {$followingTeam} bludbol on the EDS. Most of the time you have no idea what is going on.

They got smoked by the Irregular Cogs 3-0 in week 2, then got a 1-1 draw against the Carcosan Tatters and destroyed the Glorious Hounds 5-1. Then came a 2-1 loss to the Ravenous Eagles and a 3-3 draw with the Zensun Vagabonds. Then they ended the first half of the season with a 4-3 win against the Filthy Tide.

| Stacks | W-D-L | Outlands | W-D-L |
|-------|-----|--|--|
| Gore Farmers | 3-3-1 | Carcosan Tatters | 6-1-0 |
| Irregular Cogs | 2-2-3 | Filthy Tide | 3-1-3 |
| Old Wyrms | 2-2-3 | Ravenous Eagles | 2-1-4 |
| Glorious Hounds | 2-1-4 | Zensun Vagabonds | 1-3-3 |

Now there's word that another BludBol league is starting up in Stacksburg. Some of the other old-era teams that had been left out of this tournament are organizing to play for the "real" green cup.

The team you're following is 2-2-3 but [[Souta]] is third in the MVP race with 24 SPP. What now?

And that's the season.

The {$followingTeam} started off the second half with a 2-0 loss to the Ravenous Eagles, then a 3-0 loss to the Carcosan Tatters, followed by a 2-1 loss to the Gore Farmers.

The regular season ended with a 7-5 win over the Filthy Tide.
