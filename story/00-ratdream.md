# before

The gunfire had gone sporadic. More squealing and the buzz of the in your face weapons dominated. That's the time for you to break cover and start putting together the story. Now everyone involved was either hacking and slashing or keeping an eye out for who'd make it out unscathed. Well, minimally scathed. It's hard to walk away from a knife-fight without a few of your fluids escaping.

But there you go again, making yourself sound tough. It's an important part of life in the Stacks, but you don't have to like it. You don't actually have to do it either. You're Kayro Jane and you're a fucking professional.

And so you do the duckwalk low behind one of the barricades, ridiculous hivis orange hat bucketed atop your skull. It's easier than a flag, and people know you by it. They know you're working when it's on. If the gangbangers ever catch on and start wearing them too, you're going to be fucked. Well, shot more likely. Probably by some kid in goggles.

This fight didn't need to happen though, and the sound of the yelling sounds more like posturing than any real anger anymore. The brutes and the rats came down because of a rumour, words that one of the elevator teams lost some of their gear. You might as well start the exit plan. The loot was probably a lie, and even if it's not, Brom's assholes didn't need the scrap they'd make from selling it, and it's hard to overestimate the rats abilities to actually use anything they might find.

But that's the problem. You're doing it again, the thinking you know how it works down here. People scrabbling in the dark for scraps and offcuts. And thinking without looking, without seeing is how you get a knife pressed to your kidney.

"I'm noncombat," you say. Your hands don't move. It's always important to let them have the power, to surprise no one. "Kayro Jane. Media."

"Gun."

"No gun. No weapons. I've got nothing. A bottle of water if you need it." Judging by the voice it's one of the kids. Probably a rat. Brom hasn't had many hangers-on recently and if he did, the kid would have a gun.

"Water."

"It's on my belt. You can take it."

The flask is removed but the knife stays steady.

"Can I turn around?" After a couple of moments it's obvious the sounds of the up-close fighting have ended. Mostly just regrouping calls and whistles now. And the knife isn't in your guts. Good job.

It's too bad though. There's no story here. Just a couple of bands of jerks blowing off steam, looking for a useless prize.

The knife barely touched you before you whirled, using one of those moves Brom's goons always "demonstrated" down at Bugs'.

It worked, but mostly cause you had 10 kilos on the wielder, a skinny little punk dressed in rags.

"I'm noncombat," you say, your knee on his chest. "Kayro Jane. Media."

The kid knew enough not to thrash, though he was breathing hard. Probably a rat, but it's always hard to tell. Brom hasn't had many hangers-on recently and if he did, the kid would have had a gun.

"I'm not your target. I'm going to take your knife and get up. Then you're going to run. You tell whoever you need to that you almost took down someone big and scary."

You ease up and let the kid go. He looks longingly at the knife you took. It's a piece of shit, but he'll probably get some sort of beating for losing it. But he backs away. Once he's past a pipe, he starts running.

After a couple of moments it's obvious the sounds of the up-close fighting have ended. Mostly just regrouping calls and whistles now. And the knife in your hand isn't in your guts. Good job.

It's too bad though. There's no story here. Just a couple of bands of jerks blowing off steam, looking for a useless prize.

"Do you know who I am?" you ask. Your hands waggle. It's always important to keep the people with the weapons thinking about too many things at once when you're lying to them. "Kayro Jane. I'm friends with your boss."

"Gun."

Aw crap. Judging by the voice it's one of the rat kids. Probably a rat. Brom hasn't had many hangers-on recently and if he did, the kid would have a gun. Change it up; act scared. "No gun. I know where the loot is." 

The knife wobbles.

"Follow the rusty green pipe. They dropped it right by the third wheel interchange. Good gear. I would have taken it myself but it was too heavy."

You don't hear any footsteps; the kid is fast and silent but the pressure is gone. You wait a few more beats to make sure you look harmless. "Can I turn around?" She's long gone, chasing a pipeline to a mirage.

After a couple of moments the sounds of fighting start up some ways down the pipe. A few gunshots. A few screams. But the knife isn't in your guts. Good job.

It's too bad though. There's no story here. Just a couple of bands of jerks blowing off steam, looking for a useless prize.
