When Halfleg Jack was on his game, he was a marvel. I can say that not just as a fan but as a person who appreciates the marvelous in many many forms. I mean, we can talk about ballet and grace and all that shit, but Halfleg, well, he did it all without question.

Style has always been a part of bludbol.

The dump and catchwork between Halfleg and whichever partner he was working with (I remember Tremolo being one of my favourites but some of the blockers were pretty great) were the reason you watch a bludbol match. Trapped on the sidelines trying to beat the oncoming blitzers, the option to just save the ball, go for the score was always there. They said that Halfleg had eyes all round his helmet.

Sacrifice might be part of it too. Halfleg, is one of those stars that could have been drafted up to the LCL, no question. He made our league good, but never got the chance to leave.

And this is what Zaac is trying to bring back? There's something to be done there.
