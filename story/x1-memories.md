The gunfire had gone sporadic. More squealing and the buzz of the in yourface weapons dominated. That's the time for you to break cover and start putting together the story. Now everyone involved was either hacking and slashing or keeping an eye out for who'd make it out unscathed. Well, minimally scathed. It's hard to walk away from a knife-fight without a few of your fluids escaping.

But there you go again, making yourself sound tough. It's an important part of life in the Stacks, but you don't have to like it. You don't actually have to do it either. You're Kayro Jane and you're a fucking professional.

And so you do the duckwalk low behind one of the barricades, ridiculous hivis orange hat bucketed atop your skull. It's easier than a flag, and people know you by it. They know you're working when it's on. If the gangbangers ever catch on and start wearing them too, you're going to be fucked. Well, shot more likely. Probably by some kid in goggles.

This fight didn't need to happen though, and the sound of the yelling sounds more like posturing than any real anger anymore. The brutes and the rats came down because of a rumour, words that one of the elevator teams lost some of their gear. You might as well start the exit plan. The loot was probably a lie, and even if it's not, Brom's assholes didn't need the scrap they'd make from selling it, and it's hard to overestimate the rats abilities to actually use anything they might find.

But that's the problem. You're doing it again, the thinking you know how it works down here. People scrabbling in the dark for scraps and offcuts. And thinking without looking, without seeing is how you get a knife pressed to your kidney.

"I'm noncombat," you say. Your hands don't move. It's always important to let them have the power, to surprise no one. "Kayro Jane. Media."

"Gun."

"No gun. No weapons. I've got nothing. A bottle of water if you need it." Judging by the voice it's one of the kids. Probably a rat. Brom hasn't had many hangers-on recently and if he did, the kid would have a gun.

"Water."

"It's on my belt. You can take it."

The flask is removed but the knife stays steady.

"Can I turn around?" After a couple of moments it's obvious the sounds of the up-close fighting have ended. Mostly just regrouping calls and whistles now. And the knife isn't in your guts. Good job.

It's too bad though. There's no story here. Just a couple of bands of jerks blowing off steam, looking for a useless prize.
