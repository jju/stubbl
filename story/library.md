Despite what you may have heard we do have a bit of culture down in Stacksburg. Not just the culture we make ourselves, the ballet of bullets and poverty the upspire assholes love to romanticize about our lives here. I mean, there isn't an opera house, but we do have a library. And many days it is open to the public.

The library is, like so much of Stacksburg, a repurposed bit of machinery. It's a big bit, but it bears the imprint of lubricants and machine rounded edges that have been pitted away by airborne chemicals you really don't want to open your eyes too much around. It's gross and very easily too painful for most people to handle.

It was an auger or drill, not from the recent elevator project, but apparently one they'd tried back in the early days of the colony. The spirefolk thought we weren't getting to paradise quick enough so they needed more fuel. Drill drill drill and pull up all the frozen power you can handle.

This particular bit of machinery that is our storehouse of knowledge is down the bottom of a pit. I don't care much for the moleman approach so the main ramps work out all right.
