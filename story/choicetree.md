And you wake up. Again. You shake off the memories of before, back when the Stacks were a killing ground but you were alive. There are stimulants waiting for you in the machine. And depressants if you're not ready to face the world just yet.

Your terminal is waiting too. 

`Kayro. It's time to write again. The world is waking up. Give the public what they want.`

You answer the message ...

You read the EDS' message again. `Give the public what they want.` 

Ugh. EDS always resorts to this kind of pseudo-flattery. No one has heard from you in half your lifetime. No one is clamouring for anything now.

`You remember bludbol? It's back. New season, new players, new teams.`

You give EDS a bit more rope and they talk about the importance of sport and bringing communities together and wank wank wank.

`You can write what you want, the way you want it. Write up the scores, or pieces on the players or whatever. But do your thing. That thing that made everyone down here cling to every dispatch from the gang wars. This will be just like that. But with rules.`

Rules. There were rules back in the gangster times. Rules that got people stabbed and shot and half their faces melted off. That was why people read your scribbles. Nobody actually cares about pointless games, do they?

But you do sometimes miss writing for people.

You read the EDS' message again. `Give the public what they want.` Ha. You fell for this the last time a bludbol season began. EDS is good at stroking the ego.

And yet. That piece you wrote about Sabah and how the team recovered wasn't bad. You could do better this time without wasting all that effort needing to just get up to speed with what was even happening on the field. But scores and play by play aren't your thing.

`You can write what you want, the way you want it. Write up the scores, or pieces on the players or whatever. But do your thing. That thing that made everyone down here cling to every dispatch from the gang wars. This will be just like that. But with rules.`

Rules. There were rules back in the gangster times. Rules that got people stabbed and shot and half their faces melted off. That's what you channelled last season, the pointlessness of people dying. For some reason it went over well. You could do that again, right? You just need a hook.
