There was a bludbol match happening, a pickup game in the street. The players were just kids, but Zaac thought that maybe they'd be able to help. Kids on the street always knew where important people lived, right? It's not like up in the spire where that information is jealously guarded. Down in the stacks the people are part of the community. He just needed to connect and tap into that knowledge.

The kids were running scrambly plays. They looked fun and disorganized like people who'd never really held a bludbol before. It kept escaping from their grasp like they were playing with a slicked out skin rather than a ball at all. Run run run skidddd. The play moved on from the girl who'd left half her skin on the street.

"That didn't look too good," Zaac said. 

"It's okay," she said. "It grows back."

"What kind of plays do you like to run?"

"Usually Dxxx fake throws and I sneak it along."

"If she fake-throws usually, don't your opponents catch on?"

"Kids around here are pretty dumb. We do all right."

A huge bickering scrum had amassed down the block. Both Zaac and the girl watched disinterestedly.

"You have any coaches around here? Anyone who knows the game?"

She kept her eyes on the scrum. "Nope. We just play."

"No adults help at all?"

"Nope. They just make it shit."

"But you had some pretty good players around here. They don't coach or anything? Give back?"

"I don't know. Ray is pretty good and he's almost 15. We stopped playing with him because he got too fast. Then someone figured they'd need to hurt him. That would have sucked."

"Okay."

And that's how it went. Zaac asked at match after match where the actual players were.
