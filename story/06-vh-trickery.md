Who exactly makes the schedules for a Green Cup season? This answer has changed over the 11 previous iterations. The uphiver Zaac organized the GCC06 schedule himself but since then it's generally just been handed over to a computer to sort out the numbers. I hadn't really given the logistics of it all much thought until the surprise of seeing the [[vanadiumhunters]] on the schedule. I hadn't been paying attention to the UBBL Challenge [^1] but could have sworn that the [[xenothrillers]] had won the wild-card expansion slot. And they had. So where were the [[sumprunners]]?

It looks like TyrolCorp was approached by a Noordennen representative and an agreement was quietly made for the teams to switch spots. Technically there was a convoluted trade arrangement (something that the Noordennens have been all about) involving players, coaching staff and then a renaming rights exchange, so the new Hunters are technically the Runners. It's ridiculous, and there was undoubtedly an amount of money that changed hands, but no one actually wanted to watch the Sump Runners play their crappy brand of BludBol in the Green Cup so it all works out.

The [[deepdreamers]] have lodged a formal protest.
