So you settle into the EDS to watch the {$followingTeam} play some bludbol. Their first match is against the Irregular Cogs.

The game goes faster than you expected, and it's really hard to tell exactly what's going on. It looks like the feeds are just security footage from cameras suspended at weird angles over the field. Everything is washed out and blurry or overblown when the players end up just under a light. 

After a few big re-ordering of the players after one of the orange and blue-clad players went scampering up the sidelines, you figured out that the Tide seem to be faster and better at scoring than the Cogs. Without any explanation on the screen and barely any sound, the whole thing was weirdly unsatisfying.

In the end the {$followingTeam} won 5-0, though you had to look it up on the message boards afterwards. It was only on the boards afterwards that you learned [[chomps]] had actually killed one of the Cogs' rookie throwers.

It sounds like these are going to be the most interesting players to watch, or at least the ones the message-boarders are most excited about.

* [[Fikri]] - Thrower
* [[chomps]] - Old-Era Veteran Blitzer
* [[Iapheth]] - Catcher
* [[silas]] - Thrower

So that was a week of bludbol. The {$followingTeam} are 1-0-0. What now?

You watch 6 more weeks of terrible video-quality {$followingTeam} bludbol on the EDS. Most of the time you have no idea what is going on.

They beat the Glorious Hounds 3-2 in week two and the Ravenous Eagles 4-1, before losing 1-0 to the Carcosan Tatters. They got a 2-2 draw with the Vagabonds and lost 3-2 to the Gore Farmers before losing 3-2 to the Old Wyrms to close out the first half of the season.

| Stacks | W-D-L | Outlands | W-D-L |
|-------|-----|--|--|
| Gore Farmers | 3-3-1 | Carcosan Tatters | 6-1-0 |
| Irregular Cogs | 2-2-3 | Filthy Tide | 3-1-3 |
| Old Wyrms | 2-2-3 | Ravenous Eagles | 2-1-4 |
| Glorious Hounds | 2-1-4 | Zensun Vagabonds | 1-3-3 |

Now there's word that another BludBol league is starting up in Stacksburg. Some of the other old-era teams that had been left out of this tournament are organizing to play for the "real" green cup.

The team you're following is 3-1-3. What now?

And that's the season.

The {$followingTeam} started off the second half with a 4-3 loss to the Zensun Vagabonds then turned around with a 4-1 win against the Ravenous Eagles. A second win against the Irregular Cogs (this time by a 4-2 score) was followed by a 2-1 loss to the Gore Farmers. They tied the Glorious Hounds 3-3 before beating the Carcosan Tatters 2-1. A 7-5 loss to the Old Wyrms finished off the season.

## standings

| Stacks | W-D-L | Outlands | W-D-L |
|-------|-----|--|--|
| Gore Farmers | 7-3-4 | Carcosan Tatters | 9-1-4 |
| Irregular Cogs | 6-2-6 | Filthy Tide | 6-2-6 |
| Old Wyrms | 5-2-7 | Zensun Vagabonds | 5-4-5 |
| Glorious Hounds | 3-4-7 | Ravenous Eagles | 5-2-7 |

At the end of the regular season the Filthy Tide had a W-D-L record of 6-2-6, which was good enough for second place in the Outlands Division. They will host the Zensun Vagabonds (a team they have not beaten this season) in the first round of the playoffs.
