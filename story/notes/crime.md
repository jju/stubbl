The #crime storyline in GCVI follows these teams:

* [[ravenouseagles]] - led by B.R. Ossa they're the least concerned with tradition of bludbol and most in using the game to benefit their supporters primarily through gambling.
* [[zensunvagabonds]] - trying to distance themselves from the history of crime and violence in stacksburg

When GCC06 begins we add in:

* [[gargantuanbrutes]] - Brom connection to [[KRJ]]
