The #crime storyline in GCVI follows these teams:

* [[ravenouseagles]] - led by B.R. Ossa they're the least concerned with tradition of bludbol and most in using the game to benefit their supporters primarily through gambling.
* [[zensunvagabonds]] - trying to distance themselves from the history of crime and violence in stacksburg

When GCC06 begins we add in:

* [[gargantuanbrutes]] - Brom connection to [[KRJ]] the Brutes have recently(?) been evicting people in preparation for further land grabs from upcrust. [[Cornelus]] survived the gangster times and was pushed into running the Brutes  back in #t2073 and they won the first Doom Fist [[teamcasualties]]. He never really understood the way bludbol worked beyond attacking rivals. [[Trude]] handled the real estate developing stuff. Heading into GCVI, [[Zaac]] will be trying to pull the brutes in - trying to exploit some of the latent gangster image to the Crust.

Following this story leads into #investigator status.
