## politics of stacksburg

I would like to explore the politics of Stacksburg, including how bludbol may have obliterated the political sphere. If the sport is all-encompassing, along the lines of conscription into a dual society kind of thing, then we need to get into how it has taken over from the gangs as the way civil society is organized a la Fredric Jameson[^1].

[KRJ] could be lamenting the rise of the collective as a way of dealing with problems. She's coming at it from an essentially individualistic point of view, though recognizing this is better than the feral all agaianst all, but why does it have to be this way?

To be fair, this can't be a full conscription Universal Army sort of thing. But it has that kind of pull to it, to be recruited into fandom if you can't play, to need to have an opinion on the matter.

If the new utopia must be about reducing envy, and "welcome the most outrageous self-indulgences"[^2]. 

Perhaps KRJ is questioning the utopian nature of their world. That fits in with the outsiders to the Culture in Banks' stories. But we don't want this to be a story about the benefits of capitalism, just the fear of sublimating your individuality to the teamness.

Another crowd might be the abolishment of class that happens without the planning of the supercomputer[^3]. This crowd has arms and heads that are indistinguishable because they are masses of people.

I like the idea that KRJ starts to argue the idea that though BB players are exploited, maybe that's something to be gotten rid of through making everyone play. But would that get rid of the class issue? The means of survival? The basic economics?

## history of stacksburg

The elevator has come in, connecting the stacks to the core of the hive. There are tasks that need to be done to keep people alive down here. The hive is a world of its own hurtling through space, but that isn't really a concern for the people who live here. There is still no light but what is granted to then by the powers that be.

Pre-elevator was about finding power mains and making them work. Bioluminescence and radioactive patches just don't cut it when you're organizing sport. Floodlights were harsh and stolen.

>> There should be competing narratives about the origin of bludbol in Stacksburg. It can't always have been around. The uphivers can grant the burgers some version of the game but in the official rulebooks this will be the inaugural league. That players might come to it with experience and funds means nothing to the upcore.

The BRL is the quasi-officially sanctioned league people really cared about. It was suspended during the worst of the gangfighting. Those are the stats that fans want carried over into the StUBBL 

The Colony Alpha Bludbol League is the main league. That's the one that has the flashy pro contracts and all of that. BRL/StUBBL is an alternative league and one that only its adherents really love. Mostly because of the homegrownness of the players.

## star players & mercenaries

It has always been a travelling league so mercenaries totally do get involved.

## CABL

If CABL is the evil empire, maybe that's a good thing. If they're the ones trying to actually get people universal healthcare and connect up with the rest of the ship through this medium of sport. Why wouldn't you want to be part of something better? Just being different doesn't make it terrible.
