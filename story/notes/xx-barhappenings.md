* this is our season! drinks on me! -> later followup when it turns out to be among their worst #gcx
* friend comes in and starts yelling at someone else while the rest of the people want to watch the game
* person way too excited about what "their" player did -> gateway into stats?
* person way too excited about their player - stalking subplot

* "why do you have such shitty screens? I'll get you a good one barkeep!"
* fans from the better teams come in to gloat and throw their weight around #gcx
* start of the season and there's been a wardrobe change - everyone arguing about the new team colours
* "psst, did you know that person over there, she's a ref"
* annoying vuvuzela soundmaker (probably best for an UBBL Challenge plotline)
* asshole slumming kids singing from musicals in the bar
* out of booze and everyone watching dry - some people still riveted but a lot of them drifting
* stuck in a rut of glassy-eyed stares and being boorish just for the hell of it to make believe that they have some feeling in their lives
* shoes the players wear get stolen off someone's feet
* gangsters muscling in to turn the bar into a gambling den like in the old days -> corporate crackdown and isn't this better than it used to be?
* surveillance camera footage of the matches being upgraded
* political messaging on the uniforms getting coopted
* heartless corporate owners forcing play in toxic conditions -> this is what caused the massive strike that was the [[theinterruption]]
*
