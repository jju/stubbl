The #community storyline in GCVI involves these teams:

* [[filthytide]] - Playing in the Outlands, the Tide are a scrabbly hard-bitten team who's never won that much. The coach celebrates counting stats and won't give up on the players, all of whom come from the shittiest of circumstances.
* [[gorefarmers]] - The Stacks' toughest team are doing their best to rehabilitate gangsters. There are opportunities for people with other skills, but beating people up isn't one of those skills.
* The whole GCC6 storyline picks up on this.

When GCC06 begins we add in:

* [[orbitalmachine]] - corporate sponsorship from up above grim style

Following this storyline leads into #activist status.
