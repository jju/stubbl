The #ultrafans storyline in GCVI follows these teams:

* [[irregularcogs]] - the fans live and die with the team - as the GCC06 builds they have a crisis of faith
* [[oldwyrms]] - the megarivalry leads to political incursions off the pitch

When GCC06 begins we add in:

* [[darklingspectres]] - unconcerned with the product on the field

Following this story leads into #aficionado status.
