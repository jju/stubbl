What was the interruption of #t2193 ?

## Options

* massive labour strike
	* the mass elevator had been in place for 320MSec (10 years, 3 "years")
	* old era was part of a time of new domination from the Crust where crusty resources were being pushed down the pipe, a false opening up, most regular people at this time were getting flooded with consumer goods from the crust, but still being worked to death
	* the interruption shut down the elevator due to the exploitation being gratuitous
	* demanded resources be deployed to everyone
	* long slow negotiation (390MSec) where the Stacks were going through hard times, being starved out, but they won, mostly they won benign neglect and foodstock and healthcare supplies but that was all they really needed
* war
	* stacksburg revolted militarily against the overlords
	* it was quick sharp and was put down ruthlessly
	* the bludbollers tried to stay out of it
	* the tyrants still have their boot on the Stacks but there's less overt murder these days - just living under a neglectful tyranny
	* resources are distributed from above - playing actually gets healthcare
