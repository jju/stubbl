The #tradition storyline in GCVI follows these teams:

* [[zensunvagabonds]] - One of the founding STUBBL teams, and the one with the most iconic returning [[oe-veteran]] player: [[hulud]]. This could also lead into a [[strategy]] storyline as they use the most traditional/basic of the approaches.
* [[irregularcogs]] - When Gryj the Hun brought bludbol down after the Mass Elevator, they broke with tradition, making for a different kind of sport in the downbelow.
* [[ravenouseagles]] - Have the least regard for tradition of the GCVI invitees - why didn't they join the GCC06 instead?

When GCC06 begins we add in:

* [[vanadiumhunters]] - even more trad than the vagabonds

Following this storyline leads into #historian status.
