The #beautifulgame storyline in GCVI involves these teams:

* [[glorioushounds]] - they see themselves as the only true players of bludbol in its best form. They're snobby and this pushes them in the [[hype]] storyline
* [[carcosantatters]] - the natural antithesis of the Hounds. They take a pragmatic approach to defensive bludbol, which isn't very beautiful at all unless you really delve into it. They focus on patience and discipline
* [[filthytide]] - not an obvious choice, because the Tide are first seen as victims in the [[violence]] storyline but after #t2578 [[yakup]] brings them into the conversation

When GCC06 begins we add in:

* [[kaijudynamo]] - a weird playing style that has never really gelled historically

Following this tale leads into #aficionado status.
