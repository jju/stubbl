You know you don't actually have to do this, right? Since the Mass Elevator came in the Spire has been very interested in keeping all of you scrabblers down here fed and happy. Well, maybe not happy, but docile at least. A few troops on the street and loads of Crust-production-value feeds to scroll through and no real need to go out and work the way you used to.

It doesn't take long between telenovelas to figure out that EDS will show all the games in this tournament for what they're calling the sixth green cup. You got a bit confused because these look a lot different from the Upper Colonial League match feeds which are coming down the Spire. Currently, the green cup feeds are all just test patterns, not talking heads.

Whatever.

:: watch them all

570.6 - 571.6

Your brain bursts and it's both boring and confusing. This is going to go way better if you focus.

571.7 - 578.6

Quite honestly, you got bored. Scores and names are all mashing together. The $team are in the lead, but apparently they aren't very good? It's hard to say.

Meanwhile, EDS is saying there's another BludBol league starting up. But they have the real trophy or something?

> Stick with the plan. Watch all the rest of the season I started on EDS.
> These teams are boring. Maybe this new league will be better. I'll watch all these games. 
> I can watch both leagues from the comfort of my cubicle.
> Why are there now two leagues? Maybe that's my story.

:: stick with the plan

578.7 - 585.8

The regular season is done. The $team are on top. I guess there are playoffs now.
