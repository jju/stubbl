BR Ossa's office was hard to get to. There were shady tough looking characters lining all the passageways. Big ones who could have been on the field with BR and bigger ones you remember muscling everybody for resources way back when. Some of them recognize you and give you a nod. Especially the ones you never talked to. Now that they're old and softer you're a nostalgic reminder of what their lives used to be like.

But they let you past and you wait. Not too long. 

"So what are you gonna do this season?"

It's always best to start Ossa off with a question about the team, to pretend like this is a legitimate enterprise actually focused on winning a championship. Like he actually still cares about those things instead of the blood and thunder.

"We're ripping legs off of punks and shoving them up asses. That's it. That's what you get."

Jantine? Percy? You've got a couple of paths forward there... Does that mean you're forgoing wins in favour of pain?

"Yeah. I mean we'll win but the important part is to make sure when someone meets up with an Eagle they know we're going to eat them for breakfast."

Any plans for the playoffs? Specific matches you're looking forward to?

He looks distracted. "Look Kayro, I've got things to do here. I'm busy. If you want anything you talk to someone down on the field okay?"

And so you are out past the old gangers and ready to find more of a story to follow.

Watching Jantine and Ekua and Percy and Chikondi and it's hard not to get distracted by how well they all hit, and as a team.
