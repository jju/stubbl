I admit I zoned out a bit after the last Green Cup. I wasn't writing stories, digging into things. I ended up basking, like I'd finished a huge project. So it struck me a little bit odd when I started getting ready for this season that the [[ravenouseagles]] have such a stacked lineup. 

They're trotting out a couple of rookie blockers, yes, but they're paying huge bonus money to trot out their old champions. I get that [[Ekua]] is a big draw as the ''Bull Centaur'' but that they're paying him and keeping both [[Jantine]] and [[Percy]] on the payroll seems unfeasible.

I checked in with a few people[^1] who are a bit more conversant on the finances side of things than I am, and it does seem like the Eagles are overspending[^2]. Now, is there a real problem with that? 

Competitive balance could be the real victim. If one team is vastly overspending then they could win all the matches and prestige and honour and all that, right? To start the season their 2640TV is ranked 4th (but there's 580more TV on the bench which would push them to number one). Even with all of that, [[spreadzone/index|SpreadZone]] still pegs them as a team that'll miss the playoffs to teams that are way underspending them. And if they do split the Heavy duties between Jantine and Percy it's hard to see either of them able to take a [[carminefist]] over [[uli]].

All of that said, it's probably worth keeping an eye on the Eagles and their funding as the twelfth Green Cup progresses.

[^2]: The specific number I've seen is a TV of 1620 more than last season's revenues would support. To be clear, that is enough to run an entire Open Division team.
