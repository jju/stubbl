I've seen a lot of cowards. Back in the bad old days I was always right there with them, huddling behind the thickest barricades I could find, rank with the smell of piss hoping the explosions didn't find their way through. I'd imagine most of the gangsters I interviewed and kept tabs on back then saw me as one. I didn't really mind (I didn't have a gun and didn't want one, plus staying out of the way and reporting back was my job).

You can tell that Donat [[donat]] minds.

We met in an office of unclear provenance. He spent most of our main talk swivelling in his chair looking up at images of massive pieces of machinery that didn't appear to be from down here. He had a sort of studied nonchalance, like you couldn't pay him to flinch.

He wants to talk about reading plays. At every moment we'd come back to finding a seam, or spotting a weakness, how important it was.

"Did you do a lot of that from the sidelines?"

And then the sighs came out. Just because he played behind Aeson [[aeson]] doesn't mean he was always a backup. On any other team he'd have been a star.

"Have you seen the greatest game?"

I can hear as he leans in that he desperately wants me to capitalize those words. I resist the urge to push back at the time (but here, I'm not going to do it). I tell him I have, but not live.

"We were golden. So great and for it to be in the playoffs to capture the conference win with 8 touchdowns! It was an amazing day. You'll never see the like again."

"But we did," I reply. "Aeson pulled off 9 touchdow..."

"It's not the same. I did it on the biggest stage. I saw Aeson's game against the Tide. Nothing like mine. They were just trading points, no defense."

He's made a mistake here. That was a game I did see live but it was Aeson's 8-touchdown game (and Veens'). The Badger Claws lost in a massive upset where they gave up 10. The 9-touchdown match was later in the season. That was the one where Aeson dragged the Claws into the playoffs. It too was a must-win.

But we don't tread too hard on his memories. He's got a condition after all.

"I never wanted to leave the field, you know. They didn't let me play even though I could have. That was the big problem. I was able. You put me on the field and I would have scored so easily. It would have been poetry. But they took that from me. I wanted to be there."

"And that's why you jumped to the Hunters."

"Jumped? You say that like I fled. I was offered a contract under the rules and I took it. If they had wanted me to stay with the Claws they should have done something to make me want to stay. Anyway, it was time to move on after that. No one would give me any peace."

That undersells it a tiny bit. When Donat was forced off the sidelines in the first half of his first match with the Hunters the crowd nearly tore him apart. He says there was another injury that happened in there, which allowed him to opt-out of the rest of the season, but I've never seen a medical report. The cameras and other sensors we track the games with don't go into the stands. 

We talk some more about coaching, but while he says the right things about lending his vast scoring expertise to some team if they will keep him up in the style to which he's been accustomed (which is a bit of an odd thing - usually the bludbol players who're living in a style can't wait to show it off but here we are in a borrowed Orolk Machinery office) I can see the fear sneaking in. The studied calm is belied by fidgets. He scratches at the table. It's hard to picture this old (but still so young) kid dealing with pressures and actually teaching anyone anything. I don't want him to abandon a game that he says he loved, but the casual bitterness he heaps up now seems protective.

When it's time to go I haven't found any brilliant insight into Donat. No real insight into what the Hunters were thinking with him a few MSec ago, nor what they're trying to do with Nicodemus II now [[nicodemusii]].
