In most ways, Jane's hab wasn't any different from any other 'Burger's. A few metres across in either direction, a little shorter than it was wide and long. The bunk flipped up into the wall to be replaced by a table or an entertainment lounger. The kitchen wall had the normal foodstock printers and recyclers. There was loads of soundproofing for effective neighbour isolation and the shower/toilet combo corner with a privacy shield. All very standard.

What wasn't standard was the number of infosheets scattered around. Every surface was covered in heaps (where it didn't have an unrecycled foodbox) of the flimsy things. Most sheets only had a sentence fragment or two of typescript; some had Jane's scrawling commentary. Barely any were full.

Jane didn't need to work this way. Her ~~[[EDS]]~~ was connected to the Wire where she'd been finding all of this information. She could have selected and highlighted and let the machine amalgamate things into nice and neat packages of condensed information. That would have been a lot tidier. Kayro Jane had never been known to be tidy.

The mess wasn't the problem, though. The problem was that the information she needed wasn't in the mess. And it wasn't in the mess because it wasn't on the Wire.

There was loads of information about bludbol on the Wire, true. Jane had all the basics about numbers of players

Kayro began digging into the history of bludbol using the tool she hated the most: the wire. She formulated rituals to do this, hating every moment.

Everything she could discover on the wire though was about the Colonial Bludbol League. That made sense. These are the big teams from up in the crust. There were Howling Gryphons and Raiders and Ratskins[^1]. 

What she pieced together from this mess (and tucked into her EDS):

* 8 teams playing (names uncertain) 
	* [[zensunvagabonds]] - [[tradition]] history [[oe-veteran]] [[crime]] anti
	* [[glorioushounds]] - [[beautifulgame]] passing [[hype]] 
	* [[irregularcogs]] - [[ultrafans]] [[tradition]]
	* [[filthytide]] - [[community]] outlands [[beautifulgame]] speed
	* [[gorefarmers]] - [[community]] stacks [[crime]] [[oe-veteran]]
	* [[oldwyrms]] - [[ultrafans]] [[hype]] 
	* [[carcosantatters]] - [[hype]] [[oe-veteran]] [[beautifulgame]] ugliest
	* [[ravenouseagles]] - [[crime]] using the game to benefit their people [[oe-veteran]] [[violence]]
* All of them seem to be teams that played before but it's very difficult to find records from the old era.
* No connection to any of the CBBL teams
* basic rules
