In most ways, Jane's hab wasn't any different from any other 'Burger's. A few metres across in either direction, a little shorter than it was wide and long. The bunk flipped up into the wall to be replaced by a table or an entertainment lounger. The kitchen wall had the normal foodstock printers and recyclers. There was loads of soundproofing for effective neighbour isolation and the shower/toilet combo corner with a privacy shield. All very standard.

Kayro began digging into the history of bludbol using the tool she hated the most: the wire. She formulated rituals to do this, hating every moment.

Everything she could discover on the wire though was about the Colonial Bludbol League. That made sense. These are the big teams from up in the crust. There were Howling Gryphons and Raiders and Ratskins[^1]. 

What she pieced together from this mess (and tucked into her EDS):

* 8 teams playing (names uncertain) 
	* [[zensunvagabonds]]
	* [[glorioushounds]]
	* [[irregularcogs]]
	* [[filthytide]]
	* [[gorefarmers]]
	* [[oldwyrms]]
	* [[carcosantatters]]
	* [[ravenouseagles]]
* All of them seem to be teams that played before but it's very difficult to find records from the old era.
* No connection to any of the CBBL teams
* basic rules

[^1]: That seems offensive, right?
