Zaac arrived in the Stacks with a suitcase and a dream. You could tell he liked telling this story.

"I'd been looking for somewhere to expand. You know, up the spire, bludbol is everywhere. Everyone is crazy about it. Bludbol this bludbol that. And the money they spend on it is crazy! I mean look at these jerseys. You spend so much money on one of them and you only wear it to cheer on your team. I know a grown woman who'd wanted an Eagles jersey since she was ten years old. Always she wanted this thing. She doesn't play bludbol, not even a pickup game once a year. But she wants this shirt and will pay more for it than she will for something she'd wear to a fine ball or whatever people go to up there. For a shirt. And people are just pouring their money in."

The grand romance of the game is something you can tell Zaac is trying to market, but when you sit down with him it's hard to tell if he really believes in it. He jumps too quickly to the money issue. But perhaps that's a good thing. We see a lot of people celebrating the sport who try to pretend it's just about the romance, the camaraderie, the ballet with pounding, but that isn't all there is.

"Oh no, the deaths are hugely important. In the Colonial League we get a lot more of them than the BRL ever put together. If there wasn't the risk of a career ending injury why even watch?"

There are lots of reasons of course and we'll be getting some of them later. But the end of the career of Halfleg Jack was a story to be told. (killed by Nut Masher in a foul week 10 of season04, GF went on to win the next week's match as well, but was knocked out in the first round of the playoffs)
