There was a parade a few megaseconds ago[^1]. They aren't as uncommon as they used to be. It still weirds me out a little seeing the crowds all bunched up in the open under the bright lights, where any jackass with a rocket-launcher could make mulch of them. But we don't need to calculate blast radius any more. Really, we haven't for a long time. But I tried to keep my distance nonetheless.

At the head of that parade was a skinny little kid. They'd rigged up some sort of robo-legs to carry her around, they said so she could enjoy the waving and not get lost from the route, but you could see the winces behind the smile. It's hard for me to think of Veens as anything but a kid, but those little twitches of pain I recognize as age and wear and all that stuff.

We don't blow up our kids any more. Which is great. We don't make heroes out of the kids that got blown up or blew someone else up. I love that, I really do. I just worry a bit about this slow dismantling we do instead.
