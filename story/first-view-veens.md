The very first time I saw [[Veens]] play she was running around a crumbling bit of infrastructure with a ball, a couple of chark-skinned skinny-asses flailing after her. She was so light on her feet the rubble barely noticed her passing. She was quiet too before she got to their makeshift goalline, gently touched the ball to the ground and whipped it back at the other girl.

It was one of the other ones who talked to me, gave me directions or shot the shit or whatever. Obviously I didn't know her name, but later it became clear. I didn't know much about BludBol yet, only really watched a few games off the big feeds. That kid made an impression. She was an argument for speed.
