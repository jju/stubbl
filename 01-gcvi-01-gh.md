So you settle into the EDS to watch the {$followingTeam} play some bludbol. Their first match is against the Zensun Vagabonds.

The game goes slower than you expected, and it's really hard to tell exactly what's going on. It looks like the feeds are just security footage from cameras suspended at weird angles over the field. Everything is washed out and blurry or overblown when the players end up just under a light. 

There were a lot of messy scrums and it looked like the ball was out on the ground a lot, maybe because of missed passes? Without any explanation on the screen and barely any sound, the whole thing was weirdly unsatisfying.

In the end the {$followingTeam} won 1-0, though you had to look it up on the message boards afterwards. The message boards online thought it was a terrible match and the Hounds were supposed to be much much better on offense.

It sounds like these are going to be the most interesting players to watch, or at least the ones the message-boarders are most excited about.

* [[Daividh]] - Catcher
* [[Eloquence]] - Old-Era Veteran Blitzer
* [[Oiva]] - Thrower
* [[Yosif]] - Thrower


So that was a week of bludbol. The {$followingTeam} are 1-0-0. What now?

You watch 6 more weeks of terrible video-quality {$followingTeam} bludbol on the EDS. Most of the time you have no idea what is going on, but this team does not appear to be very good.

They lost to the Filthy Tide 3-2 in week two and then achieved a 3-3 draw with the Irregular Cogs before getting crushed 5-1 by the Old Wyrms. They lost 2-0 to the Gore Farmers and 2-1 to the Carcosan Tatters and finally got a 3-1 win against the Ravenous Eagles.

| Stacks | W-D-L | Outlands | W-D-L |
|-------|-----|--|--|
| Gore Farmers | 3-3-1 | Carcosan Tatters | 6-1-0 |
| Irregular Cogs | 6-2-6 | Filthy Tide | 3-1-3 |
| Old Wyrms | 5-2-7 | Zensun Vagabonds | 5-4-5 |
| Glorious Hounds | 2-1-4 | Ravenous Eagles | 5-2-7 |

Now there's word that another BludBol league is starting up in Stacksburg. Some of the other old-era teams that had been left out of this tournament are organizing to play for the "real" green cup.

The team you're following is 2-1-4 but [[Daividh]] is second in the MVP race with 29 SPP. What now?

And that's the season.

The {$followingTeam} started off the second half with a 2-1 loss to the Gore Farmers, and lost to the Irregular Cogs 4-3, then turned the losing ship around with a 4-4 draw against the Zensun Vagabonds. A second 2-1 loss to the Carcosan Tatters was followed by a 3-3 draw with the Filthy Tide. The second-last week of the season they exploded to a 6-0 win against the Old Wyrms and ended things off by tying the Ravenous Eagles 1-1.

## standings

| Old Wyrms | 5-2-7 | Zensun Vagabonds | 5-4-5 |
| Glorious Hounds | 3-4-7 | Ravenous Eagles | 5-2-7 |

At the end of the regular season the Glorious Hounds had a W-D-L record of 3-4-7, which was last in the league. As the last-place team they're awarded a 1-0 loss against the Gore Farmers in the Round of 16, depressing their official record even further.
