So you settle into the EDS to watch the {$followingTeam} play some bludbol. Their first match is against the Filthy Tide.

The game goes faster than you expected, and it's really hard to tell exactly what's going on. It looks like the feeds are just security footage from cameras suspended at weird angles over the field. Everything is washed out and blurry or overblown when the players end up just under a light. 

After a few big re-ordering of the players after one of the orange and blue-clad players went scampering up the sidelines, you figured out that the Tide seem to be faster and better at scoring than the Cogs. Without any explanation on the screen and barely any sound, the whole thing was weirdly unsatisfying.

In the end the {$followingTeam} lost 5-0, though you had to look it up on the message boards afterwards. It was only on the boards afterwards that you learned  that the Cogs' rookie runner had actually been killed by a Filthy Tide blitzer.

It sounds like these are going to be the most interesting players to watch, or at least the ones the message-boarders are most excited about.

* [[Besz]] - Old-Era Veteran Runner
* [[Dragos]] - Blitzer
* [[Arzu]] - Blitzer
* [[Karsten]] - Blitzer


So that was a week of bludbol. The {$followingTeam} are 0-0-1. What now?

You watch 6 more weeks of terrible video-quality {$followingTeam} bludbol on the EDS. Most of the time you have no idea what is going on.

They beat the Old Wyrms 3-0 in week 2, then got a couple of draws against the Glorious Hounds (3-3) and the Gore Farmers (1-1). Then they lost 2-1 to both the Carcosan Tatters and the Ravenous Eagles before ending the first half with a 4-0 win against the Zensun Vagabonds.

| Stacks | W-D-L | Outlands | W-D-L |
|-------|-----|--|--|
| Gore Farmers | 3-3-1 | Carcosan Tatters | 6-1-0 |
| Irregular Cogs | 2-2-3 | Filthy Tide | 3-1-3 |
| Old Wyrms | 5-2-7 | Zensun Vagabonds | 5-4-5 |
| Glorious Hounds | 2-1-4 | Ravenous Eagles | 5-2-7 |

Now there's word that another BludBol league is starting up in Stacksburg. Some of the other old-era teams that had been left out of this tournament are organizing to play for the "real" green cup.

The team you're following is 2-2-3 but [[Karsten]] is leading the MVP race with 31 SPP. What now?

And that's the season.

The {$followingTeam} started off the second half with a 3-0 win over the Carcosan Tatters, and then beat the Glorious Houndss 4-3. They interrupted their winning streak with a 4-2 loss to the Filthy Tide but beat the Ravenous Eagles 3-1 after that. The regular season ended by continuing their alternating successes with a 4-1 loss to the Old Wyrms then a 5-1 win over the Gore Farmers and then a 3-2 loss to the Zensun Vagabonds.

## standings

| Stacks | W-D-L | Outlands | W-D-L |
|-------|-----|--|--|
| Gore Farmers | 7-3-4 | Carcosan Tatters | 9-1-4 |
| Irregular Cogs | 6-2-6 | Filthy Tide | 6-2-6 |
| Old Wyrms | 5-2-7 | Zensun Vagabonds | 5-4-5 |
| Glorious Hounds | 3-4-7 | Ravenous Eagles | 5-2-7 |

At the end of the regular season the Irregular Cogs had a W-D-L record of 6-2-6, which was good for second place in the Stacks. They host the Old Wyrms in the first round of the playoffs after splitting the season series.
