# now

And you wake up. Again. You shake off the memories of before, back when the Stacks were a killing ground but you were alive. There are stimulants waiting for you in the machine. And depressants if you're not ready to face the world just yet.

Your terminal is waiting too. Blinking with a story idea from EDS, your "boss".

`Kayro. It's time to write again. The world is waking up. Give the public what they want.`

Ugh. EDS always resorts to this kind of pseudo-flattery. No one has heard from you in half your lifetime. No one is clamouring for anything now.

`You remember bludbol? It's back. We don't have anyone writing about it. We missed out, thought it was bullshit back in the last go-round, but people loved it. People cared. We need someone to write about it this time.`

You give EDS a bit more rope and they talk about the importance of sport and bringing communities together and wank wank wank.

But you do miss writing for people.

`You can write what you want, the way you want it. Write up the scores, or pieces on the players or whatever. But do your thing. That thing that made everyone down here cling to every dispatch from the gang wars. This bludbol will be just like that. But with rules.`

Rules. There were rules back in the gangster times. Rules that got people stabbed and shot and half their faces melted off. That was why people read your scribbles. Nobody actually cares about pointless games, do they?

`And if it makes a difference, there's some promoter coming down from the spire to see what these bollers are setting up. You don't want them to catch a scoop do you?`
