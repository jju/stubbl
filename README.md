Kayro Jane lives in an underground city named Stacksburg. This is not a nice place to live. It's dank and industrial and riddled with social problems.

She used to report on gang warfare in Stacksburg but in the last few years after the mass elevator project was terminated in the wake of a massive quake she'd gone quiet. Life in STacksburg picked itself up and continued. There is still fighting and it's still not a nice place to live, and her silence made many people think something had happened. Perhaps she'd moved up somewhere beyond the Stacks. Maybe she'd died.

This is what she was working on.
