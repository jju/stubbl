# Palace Orchids

The Palace Orchids were one of the elite teams of UBBL's Open Division (as the Orchids).

## Playbook

The Orchids use the High Extension playbook, a venerable adaptation of the Hermann technique. Generally to play this style, you need a higher skill level. The playbook uses four receivers but only two blitzers and no big guy option. The idea is usually for the thrower to hang onto the ball longer than in the Excelsior or Drop Eagle playbooks giving the catchers time to get open downfield.

## History

The Orchids have never lost more than two games in a tournament, but also have never won a tournament. 

### Seasons

Their loss in the opening salvo of the Champions Circuit was their first taste of Pro-Level play. They liked it and wanted more. They didn't make the most of it when they went back, but their exemplary regular season play in the Orange Goblet earned them the third expansion berth in the Green Cup. They also didn't achieve a championship with a final record of 8-1-2 but that second loss came in the first playoff round and they missed out again.

#### Projection GCXII

W-D-L 10-0-5

This is their year. They've made it to the big stage and will be Green Cup Champions. Fuck the new strength of competition.

### Management

### Fans

Much like the [Glorious Hounds](glorioushounds) fans were until UCIV, Gladiola fans are desperate for a tournament win. The Orchids' biggest rivals are the [Mules](kickingmules.md) to whom they lost the first Orange Goblet, and the [Thorns](thorns) who are pretty much just as good as them. They wre also bitter about the [Arboreal Menace](arborealmenace) beating them in UBBL Challenge III and making it to the big show before they could.
