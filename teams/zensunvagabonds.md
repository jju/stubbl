# Zensun Vagabonds

Usually credited along with the Old Wyrms as the founders of the UBBL, the Vagabonds have a long history of not being great. Which is kind of funny as they did almost win the Green Cup once back in the Old-Era.

## Playbook

The Vagabonds use the Hermann playbook, the original plan for playing BludBol, and the one that every other strategy is an adaptation of. The team has two thrower positions available, 4 catchers, 4 blitzers, a big guy and fills out the rest of the lineup with undistinguished concussion-fodder. Like most Hermann teams, the Vagabonds don't use all their specialist receivers, trusting more to a running game with the blitzers.

This is a team that just wants to build something of itself. Jonah and Clydon are being forced into the role of faces of the franchise when they are not ready.
