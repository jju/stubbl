# Zensun Vagabonds

Usually credited along with the Old Wyrms as the founders of the UBBL, the Vagabonds have a long history in fans' minds of not being great. Which is kind of funny as they did almost win the Green Cup once back in the Old-Era.

## Playbook

The Vagabonds use the Hermann playbook, the original plan for playing BludBol, and the one that every other strategy is an adaptation of. The team has two thrower positions available, 4 catchers, 4 blitzers, a big guy and fills out the rest of the lineup with undistinguished concussion-fodder. Like most Hermann teams, the Vagabonds don't use all their specialist receivers, trusting more to a running game with the blitzers.

## History

The Vagabonds have been getting better as of late.

### Seasons

The Green Cup X season was a triumph for the Vagabonds, marred only by the playoff loss. If they can build on that success they could be hositing the Green Cup.

#### Projection GCXI

[[Jonah]] and [[Clydon]] were being forced into the role of faces of the franchise before they were really ready. [[Betuel]] is rapidly rising in the ranks.

The Vagabonds miss the days of having [[hulud]] anchoring their lineup.


## History

Usually credited along with the Old Wyrms as the founders of the UBBL, the Vagabonds have a long history of not being great. 

### Management

Muddib is an old BludBol hand exiled from somewhere far upspire. He's ancient and grublike but knows the game. That he's been unable to create a championship force from his players rankles.

### Fans

The Vagabonds' primary rivalry is with the [Old Wyrms](oldwyrms) as the pair of UBBL Founders. They've never been nearly as good as the Wyrms, so a lot of fans see themselves as custodians of tradition instead of victory.

### Famous Games

This loss, ending the Vagabonds' GCVIII season was [[hulud]]'s final match, as well as [[yakup]]'s. It was a great game.
