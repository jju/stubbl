## History

With a timely 6-win streak the Pits champions hoisted the sixth (disputed) Green Cup. The Machine were sneaky in their physical dominance but inflicted 16 Casualties (10-3-3) in their 10-match championship run.

The GCIX season was their first in which they did not lead the league in Casualties inflicted.
