# Orbital Machine

A dominant bashing Modern-Era team, the Orbital Machine embodies a team-oriented approach. They inflict a lot of casualties and have the best winning streak in the UBBL (12 wins spanning two seasons).

## Playbook

The Orbital Machine uses the Chariot playbook. This involves four massive players on the line with everyone else more lightly armoured but able to blitz like no one's business. Passing and ball-handling tend to be a secondary consideration and get focused into whichever players show an aptitude while the rest of the team assembles the cage to roll down the field.

## History

The Machine are entirely a Modern era institution.

### Seasons

With a timely 6-win streak the Pits champions hoisted the sixth (disputed) Green Cup. The Machine were sneaky in their physical dominance but inflicted 16 Casualties (10-3-3) in their 10-match championship run.

The GCIX season was their first in which they did not lead the league in Casualties inflicted.

### Management

The Orbital Machine is owned by an industrial concern with long local ties to Stacksburg and especially the mass elevator.

### Fans

Fans of the Machine don't get on especially well with the other main bashing teams in the Pros (the [Carcosan Tatters](carcosantatters) and [Gore Farmers](gorefarmers)). Adding to the frisson with the Farmers is the disputed nature of the "true winner" of the sixth Green Cup.

### Famous Games

The betrayal at Dungardin vs the [Cogs](irregularcogs) in GCVII Week 8 was notable for historical reasons (also, it was a 2 interception match for the Machine).

This match, known as The Betrayal at Dungardin, will be under review by BludBol scholars for quite some time and I wouldn't be surprised if there were legal proceedings. The first half was lacklustre, involving a trading of TDs and a number of ill-advised passes. The interesting thing is the lack of blocks and blitzes by either team. The most obvious were taken, but no real sacking attempts.

The second half was where things went weird. Both teams were basically playing games of monkey in the middle, with no urgency or attempts to score or injure. There was obvious collusion taking place and it was easy to see why. If both teams came out of the match with a draw then they would be atop their divisions and their records would remain identical until some presumable final meetup.

But it all fell apart on the very last possession when Heep was near the endzone and received another very risky pass. And then he bolted for the TD and won. So the Cogs have a new arch-nemesis. They can't say the Machine went back on a deal, because the deal would have been illegal and might result in some major sanctions. But they got betrayed in the very moment they couldn't do anything about it in the game. And because of the divisional structure the next time these two teams could meet would be the Green Cup final (or next season). Oof.
