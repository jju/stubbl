# Orbital Machine

A dominant bashing Modern-Era team, the Orbital Machine embodies a team-oriented approach. They inflict a lot of casualties and have the best winning streak in the UBBL (12 wins spanning two seasons).

## Playbook

The Orbital Machine uses the Chariot playbook. This involves four massive players on the line with everyone else more lightly armoured but able to blitz like no one's business. Passing and ball-handling tend to be a secondary consideration and get focused into whichever players show an aptitude while the rest of the team assembles the cage to roll down the field.

## History

With a timely 6-win streak the Pits champions hoisted the sixth (disputed) Green Cup. The Machine were sneaky in their physical dominance but inflicted 16 Casualties (10-3-3) in their 10-match championship run.

The GCIX season was their first in which they did not lead the league in Casualties inflicted.

### Management

### Fans

Fans of the Machine don't get on especially well with the other main bashing teams in the Pros (the [[carcosantatters]] and [[gorefarmers]]). Adding to the frisson with the Farmers is the disputed nature of the "true winner" of the sixth Green Cup.

### Famous Games

The betrayal at Dungardin vs the [Cogs](irregularcogs) in GCVII.
