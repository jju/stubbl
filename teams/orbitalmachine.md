# Orbital Machine

A dominant bashing Modern-Era team, the Orbital Machine embodies a team-oriented approach. They inflict a lot of casualties and have the best winning streak in the UBBL (12 wins spanning two seasons).

## Playbook

The Orbital Machine uses the Chariot playbook. This involves four massive players on the line with everyone else more lightly armoured but able to blitz like no one's business. Passing and ball-handling tend to be a secondary consideration and get focused into whichever players show an aptitude while the rest of the team assembles the cage to roll down the field.

## History

The Machine are entirely a Modern era institution.

### Seasons

With a timely 6-win streak the Pits champions hoisted the sixth (disputed) Green Cup. The Machine were sneaky in their physical dominance but inflicted 16 Casualties (10-3-3) in their 10-match championship run.

They continued to win throughout GCVII but lost in the Division Finals to the [Eldritch Fatality](eldritchfatality).

The GCIX season was their first in which they did not lead the league in Casualties inflicted.

#### Projection GCXI

W-D-L 8-1-6

The Machine is due for another deep playoff run and this season could be the one where they take advantage of a tough-to-call division. The more interesting race might be to see if they can wrestle the [Iron Fist](../prizes/teamcasualties) from the [Ravenous Eagles](ravenouseagles).

### Management

The Orbital Machine is owned by an industrial concern with long local ties to Stacksburg and especially the mass elevator.

### Fans

Fans of the Machine don't get on especially well with the other main bashing teams in the Pros (the [Carcosan Tatters](carcosantatters) and [Gore Farmers](gorefarmers)). Adding to the frisson with the Farmers is the disputed nature of the "true winner" of the sixth Green Cup.

### Famous Games

The betrayal at Dungardin vs the [Cogs](irregularcogs) in GCVII Week 8 was notable for historical reasons (also, it was a 2 interception match for the Machine).
