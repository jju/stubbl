# Gargantuan Brutes

The Brutes have folded because they could not maintain the 33% Winning Rate required to maintain status in the UBBL. They were once a feared casualty-inflicting powerhouse, but now there is only nostalgia.

## Playbook

The Brutes used the Charged Puncher playbook, which uses an assortment of fodder to back up a number of specialists. They can support three Heavies in a lineup which makes for a lot of damage dealing, but the scoring threats are a bit slower than average.

## History

### Seasons

The Brutes inflicted 24 Casualties in 12 matches in the inaugural Green Cup Tournament, which is the best they ever did in Pro-level play. They were relegated by the fourth Green Cup, but came back for the Classic edition of Green Cup 06. After two tries in the Green Cup, they were relegated again in the first UBBL Challenge.

The Brutes went undefeated in the second UBBL Challenge earning the right to get back into the Green Cup division for GCIX. Along with winning the tournament, the Brutes inflicted 20 Casualties (12-5-3). This was the best they ever played.

They folded after a disastrous GCIX, which put them in danger of relegation again. In UBBL Challenge III they played nearly as well as they ever had, but they were unseated by the [Arboreal Menace](arborealmenace) who won the tournament outright. 

With an overall Win% below the 33% seen as the bare minimum of acceptability for UBBL respectability, Cornelus folded the team rather than facing the indignity of trying to claw their way up again.

It's a shame [[Marzhak]] wasn't on a better team. Players with his profile can be great. He was better than his old-era predecessor, [[Lophand]].

Before the Open Division got a major season (the Orange Goblet), [[Votyris]] was one of the top players in the division.

### Management

Cornelus is an old criminal who got involved in sports as a way to legitimize 

### Fans

The Brutes have folded so the fans mostly don their old blue jerseys ironically these days. Many transferred their allegiances to the [Ravenous Eagles](ravenouseagles) (they each beat the other once, which is the best record the Brutes had against any Green Cup team), or the Open-Division [Mules](mules).

### Famous Games
