# Ravenous Eagles

The Ravenous Eagles are often referred to as the Worst Green Cup Champions, which is all right with the Ossa ownership group as they flaunt their rings. 

## Playbook

The Eagles use the Charles Dorf playbook, which is built on a very rigid division of smash and grab labour. They use slow tacklers on the line to block off the centre, three strong blitzers and a fragile ball-handling corps (which is a faster group than the blockers, but comparatively slow across the league) to score just as much as is necessary.

## History

In the old-era B.R. Ossa was a player for another Charles Dorf team, the Black Pearl Pirates, that couldn't quite get enough wins together to break into the UBBL (that the [[Poets]] did get a crack at the Green Cup and did horribly was even more upsetting to Pirates fans). They were actually poised to enter the Green Cup V tournament, but the interruption happened and they were shut out.

After the interruption, B.R. Ossa didn't have enough clout to get his old players back together but their closeness to Green Cup glory was seen as a good storyline for the new-era Green Cup VI. He gathered a bunch of rookies and poised them to become the perfect mix of smash and grab. The only returning player he brought with him was [[Twig]], but that gave them a more than competent QB to get them through the initial weeks with an eye towards renewal and balance. 

### Seasons

Green Cup VI didn't go exceedingly well for them as they were last-place in the Outlands division (not the entire 8-team league), but they only missed the playoffs by a win. The Eagles bashed the way they were supposed to with a third-place Casualty differential (10). But they could not score this season: last-place in TDs, both raw (18) and differential (-8). Ossa would need to see about adding some speed and dexterity to the team for next season.

In GCVII, the Eagles fought from third place in the Outlands division to win it (defeating the [Vagabonds](zensunvagabonds) and the [Filthy Tide](filthytide)). From there they became Burger Conference Champions by defeating the first-place overall [Irregular Cogs](irregularcogs) and eventually hoisted the Green Cup after a nasty match against the [Darkling Spectres](darklingspectres). 

Green Cup VIII was another last-place finish in the Outlands division (though their points total would have put them in second place if they were in the Heaps). 

With the new divisions in place in GCIX there was some thought teams bashy teams like the Eagles would be at a disadvantage. That seemed to be somewhat the case, but fans had a blast watching [[Jantine]] mow through opposing teams. Their GCVII Championship meant that even being last in the Pits they weren't subject to relegation. Led by Jantine, they inflicted the most casualties 43 (28-12-3) en route to a last place finish in their division (after realignment this was now the Pits, feeding an intradivisional rivalry with the [Spectres](darklingspectres)) but they also stole the first Iron Fist from the [Orbital Machine](orbitalmachine) in the new era.

Outside the Pro Division the Eagles put together a wonderful GCV Memorial season with their retirees and rookies, then got it all together for an exciting final match. Sure this didn't mean anything but it's fun to win. The Eagles actually tied with the [Irregular Cogs](irregularcogs) for Casualties inflicted (20), but their casualty composition (11-5-4) meant they ended more careers and had a better differential (14) so they won the prize.

The Eagles then made some huge strides and in GCX their veterans got them within a whisker of another championship and secured their second Iron Fist in a row.

#### Projection GCXI

W-D-L 7-1-7

We've seen the Eagles make a dashing playoff run before, and with the Spectres seemingly rolling over for the season, the regular season might give the Eagles time to develop some support for their big 3 bashers.

[[Jantine]] and [[percy]] have been the biggest stars of the Eagles, who haven't been trying to dominate as much as get into position to put a little run together like they did in GCVII. 

The Eagles have developed a lot of journeymen, especially in GCV, but their style of play doesn't leave a lot of room for the Line players to really develop into flashy stars.

### Management

While the B.R. Ossa ownership group has a former player as its face, the resources for the (increasingly well-funded) team are more nebulous in origin.

### Fans

Fans of the Ravenous Eagles glory in their championship titles and especially love getting in the faces of fans of the [Glorious Hounds](glorioushounds). Their loyalty has been fleeting since the GCVII championship though.

### Famous Games

Even in their Green Cup winning season the Ravenous Eagles haven't put up a lot of amazing matches. Their games tend to be built on hits hits and hits. Their winning GCVII season was built on inflicting 53.58 Blocks/match which was 6 more than their Pro division average (47.53). 

#### GCVII Conference Final

Their best match was probably the (GCVII Conference Final) where they pulled off the huge upset against the [Irregular Cogs](irregularcogs).

The Eagles' [[Frediano]] received the kick and immediately moved into a cage while [[Sigfrido]] headed downfield. The Cogs withdrew from the cage, leaving Frediano to reform the cage to his left while Sigfrido headed further towards the endzone. The Cogs attempted to get in the faces of both ends of the potential scoring battery, which was neutralized, but then Frediano darted towards the sideline. [[venkata]] wrestled Sigfrido to the ground in the endzone, but he got up and out of the way for Frediano to be freed from a swarm to make the pass and catch. IC 0 - RE 1

The second quarter began with a short kick by Sigfrido. [[Dragos]] got the ball to [[besz]] after Venkata opened up a hole on their right. After the Eagles swarmed back on the Cogs, Besz stumbled trying to get away from [[Ekua]], and wound up knocked out. [[Birgitta]] recovered the fumbled ball, but was then sacked by [[Anant]], who stumbled and lost the ball trying to get clear (this whole time Saxa was waiting patiently downfield). Ekua cleared a path to the ball for Eliott, who picked it up but was immediately pushed into the crowd by Dragos. The ball ended up at midfield where Sigfrido grabbed it, tossed it to Birgitta who made a run for the endzone, but tripped as she pushed herself too fast! Dragos couldn't get the ball downfield far enough and the half ended. IC 0 - RE 1

The second half kicked off with a perfect defence by the Eagles. The Cogs headed to their left into the slightly less-threatening jaws of Ekua and Chikondi. Besz dumped off to Saxa, who darted through the center to make a just good enough pass to Dragos in the endzone. IC 1 - RE 1

On the kickoff, Frediano headed directly into a cage, knowing that drawing out a long scoring drive was the best way for the Eagles to win. Unlike the first half, the Cogs immediately began to pressure the cage while Dragos headed downfield. The cage ruptured and Frediano started running to his left with Ekua. Venkata came directly after him and got the sack, but Ekua remarkably didn't fumble the ball. The Cogs swarmed him, but he burst out of the cage and headed straight for the endzone for a TD. So much for the long scoring drive. IC 1 - RE 2

On the kickoff, there was a pitch invasion so with Besz down Karsten moved back to get the ball, but he mucked up the pass. Rather than trying to recover the dropped ball, the Eagles mobbed up on the Cogs who were still frozen at the line. Saxa headed downfield, followed by Besz and Karsten. Chikondi tried to sack Besz but she dumped the ball out to Dragos, who was then sacked by Lumusi. The ball went into the crowd, ending up at midfield where Eagles guarded it on the ground, not daring to try pick it up. The Cogs still had loads of time to score and force an overtime. Saxa moved downfield, but Dragos stumbled on his way to get the ball. The Eagles again protected the ball on the ground until the Cogs only had one last shot to grab and tie the match. Adalberto tried to grab it but was tackled going in and the ball made it out to Birgitta, who took a victorious trot downfield knowing the win was the Eagles'! IC 1 - RE 2
