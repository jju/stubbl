# Ravenous Eagles

The Ravenous Eagles use the Chaotic Dragon playbook, which is built on a very rigid division of labour. They use slow tacklers on the line to block off the centre, three strong blitzers and a fragile ball-handling corps (which is a faster group than the blockers, but comparatively slow across the league).

## History

Often referred to as the worst Green Cup Champions, the Eagles fought from third place in the Outlands division to win it, become Burger Conference Champions and eventually hoist Green Cup VII. Led by Jantine, they inflicted the most casualties 43 (28-12-3) in GCIX en route to a last place finish in their division but they also stole the first Iron Fist from the Orbital Machine in the new era.

Outside the Pro Division the Eagles put together a wonderful GCV Memorial season with their retirees and rookies, then got it all together for an exciting final match. Sure this didn't mean anything but it's still fun to win. The Eagles actually tied with the Cogs for Casualties inflicted (20), but they ended more careers (11-5-4) and had a better differential (14) so they won the prize.

[[Jantine]] and [[Percy]] have been the biggest stars of the Eagles, who haven't been trying to dominate as much as get into position to put a little run together like they did in GCVII.
