# Arboreal Menace

The Arboreal Menace are the newest entries for the Green Cup competition, having won the third UBBL Challenge for their shot. They are passers and speedsters and are part of the slow wave of skillifying Pro-Level UBBL.

## Playbook

The Arboreal Menace use the Wary Eagle playbook, which is very similar to the Scrying Avian technique, but with slightly higher skilled (and more expensive to replace) players. The lineup includes four catchers, two blitzers and throwers that have more of an option of holding back and letting fly once the catchers are in position.

## History

### Seasons

The Arboreal Menace began their existence with three straight losses in the first UBBL Challenge (against the [Mules](mules), [Machine](orbitalmachine) and [Eagles](ravenouseagles)).

In UBBL Challenge II they did much better against the bruising style of play, getting to the Quarter-finals which they lost to the eventual tournament winners the [Gargantuan Brutes](gargantuanbrutes). They lost again to the [Mules](mules) this season.

The Third UBBL Challenge was the Arboreal Menace's clear crowning achievement thus far. They won the entire tournament in undefeated fashion with a 6-win run after an opening match draw against the [Gladiolas](gladiolas).

Coming into GCX on a high, the Menace won early, but couldn't keep things under control through a long season. They ended up in last place in the Outlands division (and would have needed to beat the eventual GCX champions in week 15 to have made the playoffs).

The fourth UBBL Challenge saw a return to form where they easily made the quarterfinals against Open Division competition but couldn't advance further.

#### Projection GCXI

W-D-L 8-1-6

Current projections have them battling the Tatters for third place in the Outlands.

[[Georgina]] won the StUBBL Jumper for UBBL Challenge III. They have amazingly soft hands and there are a few rumblings that they're gunning for the Pro Interception record (they're already atop the all-UBBL list though they've played fewer games than any of the other top 5 in the list).

[[Hartwin]] was primarily a backfield passer, though she had the arm for it, she didn't go the extreme long-passing route of a [[Yosif]] or the deceased [[Adam]] or [[Ozymandias]] for the old school). The anticipation that in the Green Cup she'd need a backup did come true, and [[Susila]] is now working his way up the skill tree.

[[Laurel]] and [[Attilla]] are both remarkably good catchers but neither has made themselves part of the larger superstar picture in their first Green Cup campaign.

### Fans

As the Arboreal Menace have only completed their first Pro-Level season they don't have a lot of long-standing rivalries. Among Open-Level teams they bumped heads most with Thorns fans. In the Green Cup though, their natural rivals are the [Badger Claws](badgerclaws), who not only share their division (and use a similar fragile speedster playbook), but are also upstarts who've been promoted from Open-Division playand are eager to be the first to win the coveted Cup.
