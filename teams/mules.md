# mules

The Kicking Mules were the first winners of the Orange Goblet, a championship for the Open Division of the UBBL.  

## Playbook

The Mules use the Darvati Dorf playbook, which is built on a lineup slow tacklers to block off the centre, two attacking blitzers and two safety blitzers with a couple of ball handlers. The emphasis is on toughness and defense rather than speed.

[[Jantine]] and [[Percy]] have been the biggest stars of the Eagles, who haven't been trying to dominate as much as get into position to put a little run together like they did in GCVII. 

The Eagles have developed a lot of journeymen, especially in GCV.
