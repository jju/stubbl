## History

A youngish team, they weren't active in the Green Cup in the old-era, but have come along as fierce competitors in the post-renaissance, never having worse than a 60% win rate. In Green Cup Classic 06 the Fatality were undefeated until the Orlock Machine handed them a loss in the semi-finals. They're now seen as perennial contenders with a second place (and tops of the Pits Division and Classic Conference) in Green Cup IX. That was the best the Fatality had ever done and was right in line with the pre-season expectations.

The Fatality are just generally good at BludBol. They spread out their scoring better and with Filipa still not on the downswing there's no reason this team can't be what the Irregular Cogs have been thought to be for their existence.
