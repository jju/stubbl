# Eldritch Fatality

A youngish team, they weren't active in the Green Cup before the Interruption, but have come along as fierce competitors in the Modern Era, never having worse than a 60% win rate.

## Playbook

The Eldritch Fatality use the Drop Eagle playbook. It's an adaptation of the Hermann playbook that again requires more skilled players to run it effectively. The strategy dispenses with the catcher position entirely, instead using four skilled blitzers to run the ball, and two dedicated ball-hawks to attack the opposing ball-carriers. It's an aggressive defense that does as much work as their offense.

## History

A youngish team, they weren't active in the Green Cup in the old-era, but have come along as fierce competitors in the post-renaissance, never having worse than a 60% win rate. In Green Cup Classic 06 the Fatality were undefeated until the Orlock Machine handed them a loss in the semi-finals. They're now seen as perennial contenders with a second place (and tops of the Pits Division and Classic Conference) in Green Cup IX. That was the best the Fatality had ever done and was right in line with the pre-season expectations.

Sadly for Fatality fans they followed up GCIX with an abysmal last-in-the-Pits finish. None of the projection systems had guessed things would go so badly the Fatality would face relegation so quickly.

The Fatality are just generally good at BludBol. They spread out their scoring better and with [[Filipa]] still not on the downswing there's no reason this team can't be what the Irregular Cogs have been thought to be for their existence.

### Management

### Fans

The Fatality have a bit of a chip on their shoulder. They are a really good team that wins wins wins, but then they can't quite get the championship into their house. The [[orbitalmachine]] and [[oldwyrms]] have both beaten them on their paths to a Green Cup, and the mere fact that such an "objectively lousy" team like the Ravenous Eagles [[ravenouseagles]] has won a Cup before them rankles badly. But the lack of Cup success is only a part of using the same playbook as the [[irregularcogs]] which they are perpetually overshadowed by even though they are the better team these days.
