# Eldritch Fatality

A youngish team, they weren't active in the Green Cup before the interruption, but have come along as fierce competitors in the Modern Era.

## Playbook

The Eldritch Fatality use the Drop Eagle playbook. It's an adaptation of the Hermann playbook that again requires more skilled players to run it effectively. The strategy dispenses with the catcher position entirely, instead using four skilled blitzers and two runners to handle the ball, and two dedicated ball-hawks to attack the opposing ball-carriers. It's an aggressive defense that does as much work as their offense.

## History

The Eldritch Fatality were acitve in the lower divisions of the old-era UBBL but those records weren't kept. The Iskander family jumped at the chance to legitimize the team in the Green Cup Classic and even more so once the leagues were consolidated for GCVII.

### Seasons

In Green Cup Classic 06 the Fatality were undefeated until the Orlock Machine handed them a loss in the semi-finals. They're now seen as perennial contenders with a second place (and tops of the Pits Division and Classic Conference) in Green Cup IX. That was the best the Fatality had ever done and was right in line with the pre-season expectations.

Sadly for Fatality fans they followed up GCIX with an abysmal last-in-the-Pits finish. None of the projection systems had guessed things would go so badly the Fatality would face relegation so quickly (11-2-6 and Green Cup Champion was our thought). They did fine in the UBBL Challenge IV and didn't have to face the ignominy of playing full time in the Open Division, but they will have something to prove in GCXI.  

#### GCXI Projection

W-D-L 8-1-6 

Though it's hard to be super-confident, a division title seems likely. But it seemed that way before GCX too.

The Fatality are just generally good at BludBol. They spread out their scoring better and with [[Filipa]] still not on the downswing there's no reason this team can't be what the [Irregular Cogs](irregularcogs) have been trying to be for their existence.

### Management

The Iskander family is heavily invested in culture for Stacksburg. Where their actual funding and power came from is generally on the seedy side, but they've been here a long time, and were apparently upset they'd missed the boat in the old-era UBBL. 

### Fans

The Fatality have a bit of a chip on their shoulder. They are a really good team that wins wins wins, but then they can't quite get the championship into their house. The [Orbital Machine](orbitalmachine) and [Old Wyrms](oldwyrms) have both beaten them on their paths to a Green Cup, and the mere fact that such an "objectively lousy" team like the [Ravenous Eagles](ravenouseagles) has won a Cup before them rankles badly. But the lack of Cup success is only a part of using the same playbook as the [Irregular Cogs](irregularcogs) which they are perpetually overshadowed by even though they were the better team (at least before the shitshow that was GCX).
