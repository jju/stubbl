## History

The Gore Farmers were the first team to be relegated in the old-era UBBL after a terrible inaugural season. But in GCIV they only had 2 losses in the season. It was a shame the second came in the quarterfinals. When they came back they were better, but it was only in the new era that they began to really shine. Sadly for lovers of pure competition, Spleen Hucker was one of the first to really jump on the tanking in a lost season strategy, making their bad seasons really bad and leaving them as a .500 team overall despite being multiple champions.

In GCVIII the Gore Farmers played solid defensive caging BludBol to win the Stacks Division against a mad-scoring threat, the Burger Conference against a defensive powerhouse and the Green Cup itself against a very young and healthy mad-scoring threat. They're the first renaissance era multiple champions and did it by playing their game.

That the Gore Farmers have won two modern-era Green Cups with only one legitimate superstar is an impressive testament to the power of a solid line and the traditional caging methods of play.

### Fans

The current fanbase hates the tanking that went on in GCIX and the Farmers are going to be under the microscope for violations of the spirit of the new rules in GCX.
