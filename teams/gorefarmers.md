# Gore Farmers

When the Gore Farmers are good they can be very good, as evidenced by their two Green Cup wins in the modern era. But they can also be really bad, which has led to relegation and terrible seasons and an overall record hovering around .500.

## Playbook

The Orville-Crush approach to BludBol is traditional, simple, but also somewhat arcane. A team can use 4 strong slow and unskilled linemen, 4 faster attacking blitzers, 2 dedicated ball-handlers, 4 weak slow receivers and a nigh-unlimited supply of tough fodder. The basic idea is to get a ball handler into a cage and grind out a 2-1 win, but there are more options for the team that wishes to develop them. The Gore Farmers, for instance, *mostly* eschew the Big Guy approach.

## History

The Gore Farmers were the first team to be relegated in the old-era UBBL after a terrible inaugural season. When they came back they were better, and in GCIV they only had 2 losses. It was a shame the second came in the quarterfinals. Spleen Hucker was a thrower in that Old-Era incarnation and was the person tagged to lead the team's name to glory, which only came in the new era, winning the first modern (somewhat disputed) Green Cup in GCVI.

They followed up their first championship with a lousy GCVII, but then in GCVIII the Gore Farmers played solid defensive caging BludBol to win: the Stacks Division facing a mad-scoring threat in the first round, the Burger Conference against a defensive powerhouse and the Green Cup itself against a very young and healthy mad-scoring threat. They're the first renaissance era multiple champions and did it by playing their game.

Sadly for lovers of pure competition, Spleen Hucker was also one of the first to really jump on the tanking in a lost season strategy, making their bad seasons really bad and leaving them as a .500 team overall despite being multiple champions.

That the Gore Farmers have won two modern-era Green Cups with only one legitimate superstar (who is now retired - [[KneeMasher]]) is an impressive testament to the power of a solid line and the traditional caging methods of play. [[GutTwister]] retired after GCVI as a veteran of the old-era UBBL. He says he was glad to get a ring, but felt sidelined despite his abilities.

### Tactics

As noted above, the Gore Farmers play a traditional bashing, caging style of BludBol. What has made them a good team has been having options to deviate from that plan. When [[KneeMasher]] was still active he was a terror to passing teams and had the raw abilities to power the ball to TD himself on the other side of the field from the cage. [[Mashee]] has not been as prolific and usually only takes the field when her role is crystal clear, but that has included some of the Farmers' biggest games.

### Management

Spleen Hucker has proved to be a savvy leader of the team, but at the expense of entertaining BludBol. When things weren't going well for the Farmers in GCVII he dropped all the starters from the active roster, replacing them with journeymen anxious for a taste of Pro level BludBol. They proceeded to lose lots of matches, but the players gained skills. Then in GCVIII those skills meant he didn't need to overpay for past performance and they won another championship. GCIX meant a time to tear everything down again to prep for some even-year magic.

### Fans

The current fanbase hates the tanking that went on in GCIX and the Farmers are going to be under the microscope for violations of the spirit of the new rules in GCX.

The Gore Farmers and the [[orbitalmachine]] both won the sixth Green Cup (one Classic and one not) and that dispute over which one should really count fuelled their rivalry. The [[darklingspectres]] at this point are the team the Farmers try their best to fend off, as successfully as they have thus far.
