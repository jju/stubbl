# Carcosan Tatters

The Carcosan Tatters have always been a very good team. They're defensive-minded without really flashy stars and can lock a game down to a muddy slog even if the sun is out.

## History

The Tatters have always been a very good team. Defensive-minded without really flashy stars, they won the first Green Cup they entered as an expansion team. The Tatters didn't defend their title and lost in the quarterfinals of GCIII (but still accumulated more points than either of the semifinal losers). They bashed their way to second place in the rejuvenated UBBL which we have better statistics for. They only have two non-winning seasons on record, and the GCV Memorial was only a street level brawl, so it hardly counts.

The Tatters thrive on teamwork and defense, neither of which lends itself well to big flashy stars taking over a match. Gention has been holding things down as the best player for the last couple of tournaments (since the awful GCVII campaign in which there was a major redevelopment), but Sparrow will soon be taking her place and may emerge as the next superstar.

Though Pierre is third on the team for SPP, it's currently still in flux whether he will suit up for the GCX season.

### Management

### Fans

The GCV Memorial tournament was a bad move for the Tatters' fanbase, losing a lot of goodwill built up in GCIX.
