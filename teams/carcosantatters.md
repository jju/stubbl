# Carcosan Tatters

The Carcosan Tatters have always been a very good team. They're defensive-minded without really flashy stars and can lock a game down to a muddy slog even in the middle of a drought.

## Playbook

The Tatters use the Nergal playbook, which some (especially fans of pretty BludBol) say is one of the oldest and most insidious ways to play. The lineup consists of four strong blockers, four blitzing ball handlers and whatever dregs of fodder can be pulled off the street or opposing teams. Their biggest strengths are making everything difficult for the opposition.

## History

The Tatters have played ugly bludbol for a long time, and have only achieved ugly results in a couple of seasons.

### Seasons

The Tatters won the first Green Cup they entered as an expansion team. They didn't defend their title and lost in the quarterfinals of GCIII (but still accumulated more points than either of the semifinal losers, which got them the Tough Brake award). 

Under former player BSEncef's leadership the Tatters bashed their way to second place in the rejuvenated UBBL. While the GCVII campaign went terribly, it remains their only losing pro-level season on record.

#### Projection GCXI

W-D-L 8-1-6

The Tatters could be in position to upset for a Divisional title, but hopes are not tremendously high. The team's main goal is to get more wins than losses and to not be embarassed out there. Probably not a recipe for glory.

The Tatters thrive on teamwork and defense, neither of which lends itself well to big flashy stars taking over a match. Back in the Old-Era [[BSEncef]] (now the team's manager) was one of those big flashy stars, but he hasn't tried to develop that kind of mindset in the current players. [[Gention]] had been holding things down as the best player for the last couple of tournaments (since the awful GCVII campaign in which there was a major redevelopment), but [[Sparrow]] will soon be taking her place and may emerge as the next superstar.

Though [[Pierre]] is third on the active list for SPP and healthy, it was in flux until quite late whether he would suit up for the GCXI season. Also of note, [[Adeno]] was an old veteran who didn't do much in the revitalization but has played for the team by far the longest.

### Management

BSEncef runs the team cheaply but humbly. He basically has a grind it out ethic that a lot of fans and other players respect.

### Fans

The GCV Memorial tournament was a bad move for the Tatters' fanbase, losing a lot of goodwill built up in GCIX.

The Tatters' main rivals are the [Orbital Machine](orbitalmachine). They have a similar defensive playbook, but that's the main basis for any animosity. Fans of the Tatters, like the players on the Tatters, don't really care much for what other teams do. Aesthetically, they are near diametric opposites of the [Glorious Hounds](glorioushounds) who prefer to make everything graceful and easy looking.
