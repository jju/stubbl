# Sump Runners

They were once thought to be the future of BludBol in the old era UBBL, and were set to play in Green Cup V before the interruption. They've never lived up to that, though they are good in Open Division play. They lean more on the passing game than most generalist teams do, which can make them more fun to watch than other teams with a similar playbook.

## Playbook

The Sump Runners use the Hermann playbook, the original plan for playing BludBol, and the one that every other strategy is an adaptation of. The team has two thrower positions available, 4 catchers, 4 blitzers, a big guy and fills out the rest of the lineup with undistinguished concussion-fodder. In actuality, most Hermann teams don't use all their specialist receivers, trusting more to a running game with the blitzers. The Sump Runners have some oddities in their lineup including using a specialist thrower as a makeshift blitzer.

## History

They were once thought to be the future of BludBol in the old era UBBL. They've never lived up to that, though they are good in Open Division play. The TC Sump Runners were facing relegation in the second UBBL Challenge tournament but fought their way to third place. The Sump Runners had their own undefeated run going mowing down challengers in the B-Side of the UBBL Challenge III tournament until the Arborist scoring threat proved too much in the final.

The Sump Runners play a slightly unorthodox version of the traditional allrounder strategy. Jacquetta actually plays the role of a traditional Thrower, while Shay is more like a Blitzer.

### Management

One of the first UBBL teams owned by the TyrolCorp instead of a traditional bludbol family.

### Fans

In the past the [[vanadiumhunters]] were the Sump Runners' chief rivals, but with them relegated it's slim pickings. They had a devastating loss to the [[arborists]] in the third UBBL Challenge tournament, which may spark something moving on.
