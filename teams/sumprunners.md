# Sump Runners

They were once thought to be the future of BludBol in the old era UBBL, and were set to play in Green Cup V before the interruption. They've never lived up to that, though they are good in Open Division play. They lean on the passing game which can make them more fun to watch than other teams with a similar playbook.

## Playbook

The Sump Runners use the Hermann playbook, the original plan for playing BludBol, and the one that every other strategy is an adaptation of. The team has two thrower positions available, 4 catchers, 4 blitzers, a big guy and fills out the rest of the lineup with undistinguished concussion-fodder. In actuality, most Hermann teams don't use all their specialist receivers, trusting more to a running game with the blitzers. The Sump Runners have some oddities in their lineup including using a specialist thrower as a makeshift blitzer.

## History

The Sump Runners have never had a winning Pro-Level season.

### Seasons

The TC Sump Runners were facing relegation in the second UBBL Challenge tournament but fought their way to third place. 

The Sump Runners had their own undefeated run going mowing down challengers in the B-Side of the UBBL Challenge III tournament until the [Arborist](arborealmenace) scoring threat proved too much in the final.

Green Cup X saw the team play putridly and the faced relegation in UBBL Challenge IV, where they managed to get a couple of wins and preserved their attempts for the Green Cup.

The Sump Runners play a slightly unorthodox version of the traditional allrounder strategy. [[Jacquetta]] actually plays the role of a traditional Thrower, while [[Shay]]'s positioning is more like a Blitzer.

### Management

One of the first UBBL teams owned by the TyrolCorp entity from upspire instead of a more traditional bludbol concern.

### Fans

In the past the [Vanadium Hunters](vanadiumhunters) were the Sump Runners' chief rivals, but with them relegated it's slim pickings. They had a devastating loss to the [Arboreal Menace](arborealmenace) in the third UBBL Challenge tournament, which may spark something moving on. The absolute drubbing they took in GCX shed fans by the bandwagonload.

### Famous Games

The Sump Runners haven't had a lot of great moments in the UBBL.
