# Arborists

The Arborists are the newest entries for the Green Cup competition, having won the third UBBL Challenge for their shot. They are passers and speedsters and are part of the slow wave of skillifying Pro-Level UBBL.

## Playbook

The Arborists use the Wary Eagle playbook, which is very similar to the Scoop Caven technique, but with slightly higher skilled (and more expensive to replace) players. The lineup includes four catchers, two blitzers and throwers that have more of an option of holding back and letting fly once the catchers are in position.

## History

### Seasons

The Arborists began their existence with three straight losses in the first UBBL Challenge (against the Mules, Machine and Eagles).

W-D-L 0-0-3

In UBBL Challenge II they did much better against the bruising style of play, getting to the Quarter-finals (mid 808) which they lost to the eventual tournament winners the Gargantuan Brutes. They lost again to the Mules this season (mid 786).

W-D-L 3-0-2

The Third UBBL Challenge was the Arborists' clear crowning achievement thus far. They won the entire tournament in undefeated fashion with a 6-win run after an opening match draw against the Gladiolas (mid 1006).

W-D-L 6-1-0

The big three for the team going into GCX are Georgina (Catcher pid 842), Hartwin (Thrower pid 845) and Attilla (Catcher pid 844).

Georgina won the StUBBL Jumper for UBBL Challenge III. They have amazingly soft hands and there are a few rumblings that they're gunning for the Pro Interception record (already sitting at 5 in the all-UBBL list though they've played fewer than half as many matches as Gaenor in 4th).

Hartwin is primarily a backfield passer, though she has the arm for it, she hasn't gone the extreme long-passing route of a Yosif (pid 45) or the deceased Adam (pid 875) or Ozymandias for the old school). The anticipation is that in the Green Cup she'll need a backup.

Attilla has a slight edge on Georgina for scoring prowess, but so far that's been mostly due to being the extra outlet for Hartwin to go to. Georgina is (so far) the more pretty player to watch, though we'll see what kind of results these players get against tougher opposition.
