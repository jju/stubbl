## History

Almost exactly a .500 team but without the championships the [Gore Farmers](gorefarmers) managed to pick up.

The Kaiju Dynamo entered the first UBBL Challenge with a single goal: developing Sabah into a scoring threat. That they managed to pull off second place while fielding mostly rookies and scrubs is a testament to the weirdness of BludBol.

The Kaiju Dynamo finished on top of the GCVIII regular season standings, defying all expectations. It was just a tiny bit of bad luck that kept them from the Classic Conference title. The players aren't too distraught, though the doubters will probably see this as the team's peak.

Sabah was basically the entire strategy of the GCVIII team, and he was great at the time. Now, he's been hit around the head too much and can't be relied upon, so the Dynamo need to develop some other means of getting the ball to the endzone.

Starfin will do his best to get the ball to a scorer, but he is no Nakayama.
