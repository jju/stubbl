[[Vrej]] came back from a fine retirement to play in the Green Cup V Memorial tournament and while that was enough to push him up the all-time Hunters hall of fame, it also cost him his life.

### Management

### Fans

The Hunters have been around a long time and in the Old-Era had one of the best players in the business. Their fans love their traditional style and get really angry at teams like the [[kaijudynamo]] who try new-fangled approaches to the game.
