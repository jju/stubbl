# Old Wyrms

Even when they're bad they aren't that bad. And when they're good they're dazzling. They are the UBBL's only four-time champions and the only team to have defended a championship (twice).

## Playbook

The Wyrms use what's known as the Excelsior playbook, where a fast fragile receiving corps works together downfield making catches in traffic and getting out of trouble. It's a shorter-passing game than the High Extension playbook used by the [Glorious Hounds](glorioushounds) but when you can avoid injury it's very effective, as the Wyrms have shown.

## History

The Old Wyrms are a founding team of the UBBL (and actually joined when it was known as the Bottom Rung League) and are almost universally loathed because of their winning ways.

### Seasons

While they lost the inaugural Green Cup to the [Irregular Cogs](irregularcogs) they had a replacement player [[Newb]] pick up the season MVP. They would go on to have several more chances but the rivalry had begun. The Old Wyrms were on their way to another Green Cup appearance in GCII when they got absolutely mauled by the Cogs in the last week of the regular season.

The Wyrms fought through a lot of injuries to win the GCIII title then became the first and so far only team to defend a Green Cup win in GCIV. Of course, their efforts at a three-peat were foiled by the interruption of the GCV season, but there was no chance they weren't coming back to the league in the modern era.

After a lackluster few renaissance-era seasons (only 6 wins in each 16 game season) the Old Wyrms were undoubtedly the best team in the league in GCIX, with high expectations and impeccable execution through their aerial attacks as they emerged Stacks Division and Burger Conference Champions.

They followed that up in the GCV Memorial tournament as the best team in the tournament until they entered the playoffs, losing to the 8th place [Vanadium Hunters](vanadiumhunters).

The Tenth Green Cup championship also went to the Old Wyrms, though it wasn't the same kind of dominating season as the year before. The early weeks were filled with draws and their final record shows their offense was 10 TDs worse than previously, but their defense limited the damage. By the end they didn't need to be perfect, just better than their opponents, which they were.

#### Projection GCXI

W-D-L 9-1-5

The Wyrms will win the Stacks division, but fall in the Burger Conference Final.

Having the second-best player the UBBL has ever seen in [[souta]] has gone pretty well for the Wyrms. That she wasn't used in the GCIX final is one of the things BludBol fans will always have an opinion on.

### Management

Hems is the son of an old-Era veteran thrower for the Wyrms. He has a ruthless approach to winning. His roster manipulation in the GCIX championship run made for new rules of only allowing 4 veterans in reserve in GCX.

### Fans

As the winningest team in the UBBL, Wyrm fans can be among the most despised. From their end, however, the main rivalries are with the [Zensun Vagabonds](zensunvagabonds) as the two "Founders" of the UBBL, the [Irregular Cogs](irregularcogs) (mostly for historical reasons), and the [Gore Farmers](gorefarmers), who have won as many Green Cups in the modern era (and share the Stacks division with them).

### Famous Games

The match everyone would really like to see is the one at the end of the GCII regular season that made the Cogs/Wyrms rivalry so intense but the records have been lost.

The Green Cup X championship game was pretty great.
