# Old Wyrms

Even when they're bad they aren't that bad. And when they're good they're dazzling.

## History

The Old Wyrms are a founding team of the UBBL (and actually joined when it was known as the Bottom Rung League) and are almost universally loathed because of their winning ways.

While they lost the inaugural Green Cup to the [Irregular Cogs](irregularcogs) they had a replacement player [[Newb]] pick up the season MVP. They would go on to have several more chances but the rivalry had begun. The Old Wyrms were on their way to another Green Cup appearance in GCII when they got absolutely mauled by the Cogs in the last week of the regular season.

The Wyrms fought through a lot of injuries to win the GCIII title then became the first and so far only team to defend a Green Cup win in GCIV. Of course, their efforts at a three-peat were foiled by the interruption of the GCV season, but there was no chance they weren't coming back to the league in the modern era.

After a lackluster few renaissance-era seasons (only 6 wins in each 16 game season) the Old Wyrms were undoubtedly the best team in the league in GCIX, with high expectations and impeccable execution through their aerial attacks as they emerged Stacks Division and Burger Conference Champions.

They followed that up in the GCV Memorial tournament as the best team in the tournament until they entered the playoffs, losing to the 8th place [Hunters](vanadiumhunters).

Having the second-best player the UBBL has ever seen in [[Souta]] is pretty good. That she wasn't used in the GCIX final is one of the things BludBol fans will always have an opinion on.

### Tactics

The Wyrms use what's known as the Excelsior playbook, where a fast fragile receiving corps works together downfield making catches in traffic and getting out of trouble. It's a shorter-passing game than the High Extension playbook used by the [Glorious Hounds](glorioushounds) but when you can avoid injury it's very effective, as the Wyrms have shown.

Roster manipulation in the GCIX championship run made for new rules of only allowing 4 veterans in reserve in GCX.
