# Gladiolas



## Playbook

The Gladiolas use the High Extension playbook, a venerable adaptation of the Hermann technique. Generally to play this style, you need a higher skill level. The playbook uses four receivers but only two blitzers and no big guy option. The idea is usually for the thrower to hang onto the ball longer than in the Excelsior or Drop Eagle playbooks giving the catchers time to get open downfield.

### Fans

Hounds fans generally despise teams that aren't trying to play aesthetically beautiful BludBol, so the [[ravenouseagles]] and [[carcosantatters]] are the most common targets of their ire.
