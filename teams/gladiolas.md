# Gladiolas

The Gladiolas are one of the elite teams of UBBL's Open Division.

## Playbook

The Gladiolas use the High Extension playbook, a venerable adaptation of the Hermann technique. Generally to play this style, you need a higher skill level. The playbook uses four receivers but only two blitzers and no big guy option. The idea is usually for the thrower to hang onto the ball longer than in the Excelsior or Drop Eagle playbooks giving the catchers time to get open downfield.

### Management

### Fans

Much like the [Glorious Hounds](glorioushounds) fans were until UCIV, Gladiola fans are desperate for a tournament win. The Gladiolas' biggest rivals are the [Mules](mules) to whom they lost the first Orange Goblet, and the [Thorns](thorns) who are pretty much just as good as them. They are also bitter about the [Arboreal Menace](arborealmenace) beating them in UBBL Challenge III and making it to the big show before they could.
