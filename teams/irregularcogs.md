# Irregular Cogs

The team of history that has never managed to re-live up to it. The Irregular Cogs won the inaugural Green Cup against their archrivals the [Old Wyrms](oldwyrms). Then came a long period of good play but few results.

## Playbook

The Irregular Cogs use the Drop Eagle playbook. It's an adaptation of the Hermann playbook that again requires more skilled players to run it effectively. The strategy dispenses with the catcher position entirely, instead using four skilled blitzers to run the ball, and two dedicated ball-hawks to attack the opposing ball-carriers.  The Cogs have been known to score more of their TDs on defense because of their aggressive style of defending.

## History

The team of history that has never managed to re-live up to it. The Irregular Cogs won the inaugural Green Cup against their archrivals the [Old Wyrms](oldwyrms) in a thrilling 3-2 game. Then a long period of good play but few results. 

In the first unified renaissance Green Cup the Irregular Cogs snuck through the GCVII season, playing well, but without the gaudy win streak of the Machine. They amassed the most tournament points through the regular season and when the Machine was knocked out of the playoffs they looked to be a Green Cup lock. But they were defeated in the Burger Conference final by the [Ravenous Eagles](ravenouseagles) and came in third instead.

Second place for the rookies and the Cogs' best showing in many a season (in a GCV Memorial tournament that doesn't count and was only a cash-grab). The Cogs are mostly happy they did better than the Wyrms in the end.

[[Besz]] played in the old-era. No one has any proof she didn't play in all the matches she says she did (as an underused backup to Halfleg), but no one quite believes her either. (Updated: Besz played 4 games in the old era. Her stats above now reflect this.) She's still good, and the heart of the Cogs, though Alexandros is trying to take over the position.

### Fans

The fans are hugely back into the Cogs after GCIX and they are bursting for another championship.

The Cogs and the [[oldwyrms]] are traditional rivals, and the fact the Cogs won the first Green Cup is the bright point for the Cogs in that history. More recently, the [[orbitalmachine]] made the Cogs' shit list in "the Battle of Dungardin" and they're always looking over their shoulders at the [[eldritchfatality]] who use the same playbook.
