# Filthy Tide

The Filthy Tide are often called the best team to never win the Green Cup. They're an Original 8 team that has had two of the best scorers in the UBBL [[Yakup]] and [[Sardines]] but has never been able to convert the big win to get their stars a championship. Now they are in rebuild mode.

## Playbook

The Filthy Tide uses the Scrying Avian playbook which emphasizes speed above all else, especially the health of your own players. With proper training it's possible to have a super-fast scorer onside, which makes the lack of defensive ability easier to overcome.

## History

The UBBL pennant is no Green Cup, but the Filthy Tide have been a storied team the entire existence of the league (in its various forms) and had never won anything. This victory whetted their appetite for a Green Cup somewhere in their future. Perhaps merely by playing the most matches, the Filthy Tide inflicted the most casualties in this tournament, 16 (11-5-0).

Their GCIX campaign was devastating to a team of such history. They put their efforts in the GCV Memorial tournament to develop a replacement for Yakup and rather than learning a more conservative style of play to match up with their current team's abilities they are pinning their entire season's fortunes on Venus, a young player who scored a TD and looked fast doing it.

Somfuhr inflicted the most casualties of any player in the Pro Division, while for a time [[Yakup]] seemed untouchable in his scoring abilities. That they couldn't convert this dynamic duo into more than a third place finish is heartbreaking. 

### Management

Sentimental fan of counting stats and wouldn't take out players past their prime when they needed to be.

### Fans

The Filthy Tide have long been in the shadow of the [[oldwyrms]]. They have had great individual players but no team success. Tide fans see Wyrms supporters as arrogant blowhards, but they hate Wyrms management even more for their unsentimental business first approach to winning. Tide fans also see the [[badgerclaws]] as an up and coming rival, and would love to see their star [[Aeson]] retire, preferably without a Green Cup ring.

### Famous Games

The UBBL Challenge semifinal with all the scoring. GCX Week 9 with even more scoring.
