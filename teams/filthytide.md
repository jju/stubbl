## History

The UBBL pennant is no Green Cup, but the Filthy Tide have been a storied team the entire existence of the league (in its various forms) and had never won anything. This victory whetted their appetite for a Green Cup somewhere in their future. Perhaps merely by playing the most matches, the Filthy Tide inflicted the most casualties in this tournament, 16 (11-5-0).

Their GCIX campaign was devastating to a team of such history. They put their efforts in the GCV Memorial tournament to develop a replacement for Yakup and rather than learning a more conservative style of play to match up with their current team's abilities they are pinning their entire season's fortunes on Venus, a young player who scored a TD and looked fast doing it.

Somfuhr inflicted the most casualties of any player in the Pro Division, while for a time Yakup seemed untouchable in his scoring abilities. That they couldn't convert this dynamic duo into more than a third place finish is heartbreaking.
