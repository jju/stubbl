# Darkling Spectres

While of late the Darkling Spectres have been mired in mediocrity, they can be an effective defensive team. Their ownership sees the team as primarily a profit centre since on-field results have been hard to come by recently.

## Playbook

The Spectres use the traditional Unglewort playbook. They have nigh-unlimited cheap slow fodder for the line that funnel opposition towards the reliable massive blockers. Two blitzers attack opposing ball-carriers, and up to four runners supply all of the speed, though they are very fragile.

## History

The Spectres have been mired in mediocrity of late, but the rejuvenated UBBL has led them to their best tournament results. 

### Seasons

Their best pro season was the short GCC06 in which The Spectres handily won their division but injuries deprived them of their stars in the Green Cup final. They won the Heaps again in GCVII and then the Classic Conference, but lost to the [Eagles](ravenouseagles) in a battle of not that impressive win record teams (fans say they had a lot of heart).

There've been rumblings that ownership wanted to take their money and run, folding the team. Their lacklustre play in UBBL Challenge III lent weight to the idea, but they returned for the GCX. Everyone was watching them to see if they'd be tanking, but they ended up making the playoffs (on the backs of a surprisingly bad [Eldritch Fatality](eldritchfatality) team.

#### Projection GCXI

W-D-L 6-2-7 

The starting lineup being shown off in pre-GCXI training camps is surprising. While it does manage to stay above the 1700 Value Floor set for the season, it's hard to see how these scrubs are going to stay out of last place in the Heaps.

For a very long time this team relied way too much on [[toomsii]] who was fragile as hell, but they didn't have anyone really special in the wings to replace him. Now [[Channing]] takes that role but with the support of [[gojko]] and [[Olufunmi]] they can spread some of the offensive work around a bit better.

### Management

The Lake ownership group makes a lot of money on this team and there isn't a lot of demand at the top for high-level play or competitiveness.

### Fans

The Spectres have come close to winning the Green Cup a couple of times, but have been thwarted by similarily bashing teams. Fans hate it when the schedule comes up against the [Orbital Machine](orbitalmachine) or the [Gore Farmers](gorefarmers).

### Famous Games

The Spectres' most impactful match came in the GCC06 semifinals.
