# Glorious Hounds

The Hounds are all about deep passes to wide open receivers and how that is "the only true way" to play BludBol. They have never quite lived up to their own hype, but it is impossible to deny the prettiness of their game.

## History

The Hounds fought and fought in the old-era to gain admission to the Green Cup circuit. When they finally did, they came in second place with a match that just didn't measure up to even average play. And then it was the last season to be played. The Hounds couldn't make their new lineup of rookies play worth a damn in Green Cup VI, but since then they've never had less than a winning record.

Costache had an injury making her slightly more expensive than her effectiveness warrants, but a better all-round receiver we see only rarely.

Yosif is the best pure passer the UBBL has seen, and that includes Ozymandias, who has actually (amazingly) seemed to be okay with the eclipsing of his talent.

Oiva was an excellent ball-hawk, but not quite the Green Cup best.

Past that we start getting into stars that are replaceable within a season.  

### Management

### Fans

The team has been on a recent slide with its fanbase, which is kind of weird since they actually pulled off a gain in lovable losers type in GCVI where they only won 3 matches.

### Famous Games

The 8-0 drubbing of the Gargantuan Brutes is basically a perfectly played match. The only way to really improve upon it would be to have a 1-turn scorer on the pitch, which the Hounds never had the luxury of fielding.
