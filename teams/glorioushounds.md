# Glorious Hounds

The Hounds are all about deep passes to wide open receivers and how that is "the only true way" to play BludBol. They have never quite lived up to their own hype, but it is impossible to deny the prettiness of their game.

## Playbook

The Glorious Hounds use the High Extension playbook, a venerable adaptation of the Hermann technique. Generally to play this style, you need a higher skill level. The playbook uses four receivers but only two blitzers and no big guy option. The idea is usually for the thrower to hang onto the ball longer than in the Excelsior or Drop Eagle playbooks giving the catchers time to get open downfield.

## History

The Hounds fought and fought in the old-era to gain admission to the Green Cup circuit. When they finally did, they came in second place with a match that just didn't measure up to even average play. And then it was the last season to be played. The Hounds couldn't make their new lineup of rookies play worth a damn in Green Cup VI, but since then they've been generally much better. They were projected to be Heaps champions in GCX, but ended up last place in the division. No one could really tell why things went so poorly, but they did.

[[Costache]] had an injury making her more expensive than her effectiveness warrants, but a better all-round receiver we see only rarely.

[[yosif]] is the best pure passer the UBBL has seen, and that includes Ozymandias, who has actually (amazingly) seemed to be okay with the eclipsing of his talent.

[[Oiva]] was an excellent ball-hawk, but not quite the Green Cup best.

[[Ziba]] isn't high up in the pantheon of Glorious Greats yet, but she's the fastest catcher the team has ever had, and with proper support, could make a run at some of the individual prizes currently held on lockdown by [[aeson]].

Past that, we start getting into stars that are replaceable within a season.  

### Management

Ozymandias runs the team, and like many of the other former players, he runs it with an eye towards a love of the game first. He wants his players to play beautifully and they practice with that in mind. 

### Fans

The team has been on a recent slide with its fanbase, which is kind of weird since they actually pulled off a gain in lovable losers type in GCVI where they only won 3 matches.

Hounds fans generally despise teams that aren't trying to play aesthetically beautiful BludBol, so the [[ravenouseagles]] and [[carcosantatters]] are the most common targets of their ire.

### Famous Games

The 8-0 drubbing of the [Gargantuan Brutes](gargantuanbrutes) in GCVII was basically a perfectly played match. The only way to really improve upon it would be to have a 1-turn scorer on the pitch, which the Hounds never had the luxury of fielding.

In UBBL Challenge IV they had that speedster but managed only(!) another 8-0 win. These textbook displays are amazing things to study, as all true fans of BludBol should do.
