## History

The Cackling Furies aren't an original Green Cup team, but in their second season (GCIII) they laid a lot of smack down, winning the Doom Fist and placing second overall to a just more talented Old Wyrms team. After that it took a long time to work back to a winning season in Green Cup play, but they managed it in GCIX.
