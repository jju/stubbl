# Cackling Furies

The Cackling Furies are an Old-Era expansion team that can cause a lot of injuries, but will take a lot in exchange.

## Playbook

The Furies use the Norton playbook, which is mostly a way to get less skilled players to channel their energy into flinging themselves at the opposition in a terrible frenzy. The use a couple of strong ball-hawks, some blitzers, even receivers, but all one sees when a team is going Norton is whirling masses of limbs and teeth. To do this they can't protect themselves very well, so there is a lot of roster turnover.

## History

The Cackling Furies aren't an original Green Cup team, but in their second season (GCIII) they laid a lot of smack down, winning the Doom Fist and placing second overall to a just more talented Old Wyrms team. After that it took a long time to work back to a winning season in Green Cup play, but they managed it in GCIX.

### Management

### Fans

Cackling Furies fans don't have a lot of rivalries, getting in everyone's faces about evenly. They do, however, dislike the [[oldwyrms]] quite vehemently. The Furies' style of play can make them quite dangerous to the (fragile) Wyrms as well.

### Famous Games

The one where Yusra got 3 interceptions in one match and then died.

The UBBL Challenge match with all the casualties.
