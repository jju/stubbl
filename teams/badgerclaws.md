# Badger Claws

The Badger Claws fought their way into Green Cup play from the Open Division through the UBBL Challenge and have never had a season below .500. They also have the greatest scorer in UBBL history -- [[Aeson]] -- playing for them.

## Playbook

The Badger Claws use the Scrying Avian playbook which emphasizes speed above all else, especially the health of your own players. The position slots only include 2 blitzers, but have 2 throwers, 4 catchers (sometimes more accurately labelled runners), and a heavy available. With proper training it's possible to have a super-fast scorer onside, which makes the lack of defensive ability easier to overcome.

## History

While the Claws have never not had a winning season, they've also never won a championship.

### Seasons

The Badger Claws did not win the first UBBL Challenge (which was a bigger affair and much tougher for challenger teams who had to face two established Green Cup teams in Pool Play). But as the top-finishing challenger they won the right to play the last-place [Brutes](gargantuanbrutes) for their spot in the Green Cup.

After defeating the [Brutes](gargantuanbrutes) 5-2, the Badger Claws went off on a tear in the Green Cup VIII tournament. They slowed down around the midpoint but made it through the playoffs with upset after stunning upset until facing down the [Gore Farmers](gorefarmers) in the final. And losing, but still. What a run.

Green Cup IX went even better for the Claws as far as wins go, but they were knocked out of the Conference Finals by the [Old Wyrms](oldwyrms), so they had to be satisfied with third place.

The projections for GCX had the Claws as 10-game winners and at least conference champions. They didn't manage that because of the incredibly competitive Outlands division, but did squeak through to the conference finals where they lost to the [Old Wyrms](oldwyrms) again.

#### Projection GCXI

W-D-L 9-1-5

There is no doubt that the Badger Claws can score. The question is if their defense can manage to hold off enough key plays to make them Green Cup Champions. Anything less is going to feel like a failure in [[Aeson]]'s probable final season.

Obviously when we talk about the Badger Claws we have to talk about the best player the UBBL has ever seen, [Aeson](../players/aeson). Aeson's SPP total in GCIX alone eclipse hundreds of players.

Aeson and [[donat]] started out similarly but Donat got a serious concussion and development slowed. In the off-season after GCX, Donat was the first player in the UBBL to be sold under the new free agency rules. He ended up with the Open Division [Vanadium Hunters](vanadiumhunters) for Orange Goblet II, where he was crippled in his first match and withdrew from BludBol entirely.

[[Cleve]] is one of the biggest stars in the UBBL who has never scored a touchdown (3rd in the all-UBBL list and 3rd in the Pro Division). What makes it even more remarkable is how many times he touches the ball without going for the endzone himself.

It will eventually be a problem that all their good players have peaked and are getting more expensive by the season and there's not a lot of skill waiting in the wings. 

### Management

### Fans

The Badger Claws had a major fan surge (FF +4 over the 9-2-8 season) in their first Green Cup tournament. The team has a few rivalries going to sustain it. The [Arboreal Menace](arborealmenace) are a natural rival as the new upstart little sibling in the Green Cup world, while their use of the same playbook as the [Filthy Tide](filthytide) make for some natural "Who did it better?" kinds of comparisons. Then there's the [Old Wyrms](oldwyrms), the team that's stopped the Claws in the conference finals every time they've shared the Burger Conference.

### Famous Games

The Green Cup VIII Conference Final against the [Kaiju Dynamo](kaijudynamo) was an insanely intense score-fest right to the end, when an ill-timed stumble for the Dynamo cost them the match 8-7. That was the highest scoring match seen to that time.

The Badger Claws did break that high scoring record, albeit in a 10-8 loss to the underdog Filthy Tide in [Week 9](../seasons/gcx/week09) of the GCX season.
