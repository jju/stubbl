# Badger Claws

The Badger Claws fought their way into Green Cup play from the Open Division and have never had a season below .500. They also, as of Green Cup X, have the greatest scorer in UBBL history playing for them.

## Playbook

The Badger Claws use the Scrying Avian playbook which emphasizes speed above all else, especially the health of your own players. With proper training it's possible to have a super-fast scorer onside, which makes the lack of defensive ability easier to overcome.

## History

Never not had a winning season.

### Seasons

The Badger Claws did not win the first UBBL Challenge (which you may remember was a bigger affair and was much tougher for challenger teams who had to face two established Green Cup teams in Pool Play), but as the top-finishing challenger they won the right to play the last-place Brutes for their spot in the Green Cup.

W-D-L 4-1-1

After defeating the Brutes 5-2, the Badger Claws went off on a tear in the Green Cup VIII tournament. They slowed down around the midpoint and were knocked out of the playoffs early but in all had a very good debut season in the Pros.

W-D-L 9-2-8

Green Cup IX went even better for the Claws, but again they were knocked out of the playoffs early.

W-D-L 11-3-4

#### Projection

10-2.5-6

Green Cup Champions or bust (more likely to be conference champs)

Obviously when we talk about the Badger Claws we have to talk about the best player the UBBL has ever seen, [[Aeson]]. Aeson's SPP total in GCIX alone eclipse hundreds.

Aeson and [[Donat]] started out similarly but Donat got a serious concussion and development slowed

[[Cleve]] top of touches without TD

Will eventually be a problem that all their good players have peaked and there's not a lot of skill waiting in the wings. GCX is do or die time for the Claws so they don't turn into the Filthy Tide who wasted the [[Yakup]] years.

### Management

### Fans

The Badger Claws had a major fan surge (FF +4 over the 9-2-8 season) in their first Green Cup tournament. The team has a few rivalries going to sustain it. The [[arborists]] are a natural rival as the new upstart little sibling in the Green Cup world, while their use of the same playbook as the [[filthytide]] make for some natural "Who did it better?" kinds of comparisons. Then there's the [[kaijudynamo]] a team that almost no one takes seriously, but the Claws have consistently had to get through in their playoff runs.
