In the individual player stat pages we keep the basic box scores under Basic Stats (both as a Pro-Level total and by Season). Prize Stats are the kinds of stats used to determine individual awards in a season. Prize winning totals are **highlighted** in the tables. We may also include further stats of interest on a player by player basis.
