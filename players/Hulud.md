Hulud is the actual leader in UBBL games played. He was there from the beginning of the Zensun Vagabonds, and from current records it appears he never missed a match. 

After the Interruption when he returned with the Vagabonds he took a pay cut as most of the old veterans did, which meant he missed out on his actual earning potential.

He retired after GCVIII. 1262.652.4 (1.15GSec ~37yo)
