Mashee is one of the players that Spleen Hucker has moved in and out of the lineup. Never a mainstay, and often sitting on the bench but an important changeup option when the match requires.

She scored the winning TD in overtime to get the Farmers their first Green Cup, was relieved of duties in GCVII (after acquiring a niggling knee injury), then came back in GCVIII where she scored again in the Green Cup final.

Recently she's bulked up a little more making her a tougher target than the other receivers the Farmers (sporadically) use (like [[Nuru]] who was left out of GCIX altogether) but she remains a slower option.
