# Daividh

[[glorioushounds]][[catcher]][[gcvi]][[gcvii]][[superstar]][[dead]]

Daividh was the first homegrown Modern Era star. He performed with grace in his first season, but was developing into a tougher defensive player for the Hounds when he was killed in GCVII by a Heavy freebooting with the last-place [Tatters](../teams/carcosantatters).
