Besz is a veteran of the old UBBL, though she joined the Cogs as a replacement for Halfleg Jack and didn't play with the legend. Her Games Played stat is thus inflated beyond its true standing (she had 4 games in the Old-Era so subtract 43 from her currently recorded GPs to get 70).

That said, records of the old-era UBBL are spotty but we're pretty sure she achieved enough playing time to get some veteran-type status (21 SPP) which would be enough to propel her to legendary status (and the pay bump it brings) now.

This is an ongoing dispute with the Irregular Cogs' management.

Soft retirement before GCX at 1.173GSec old (~37yo).
