Somfuhr ended his career as the Pro Division Casualty Leader with 50. It took a lot of matches past his prime to get that counting stat and eclipse his rival [[Rohit]]'s total of 49. Though Somfuhr never did get to win a Green Cup, he helped the Tide win an UBBL Pennant and received the GCVIII Carmine Fist.
