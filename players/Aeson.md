Aeson holds all sorts of records, including the best single match performance (of 8 TDs and MVP for 29 SPP, which is more than all but 14 players achieved in the first half of the GCX season).

Aeson came up in the UBBL Challenge with [[Donat]], and the main difference between the two players has been one of durability. Aeson has peaked as a legendary player but remains healthy. It remains a weirdness of the business side of BludBol that Aeson is only just barely in the top 50 best paid players in the Pro Circuit.
