# Adeno

[[carcosantatters]][[players/oe-veteran]][[gcvi]][[star]][[blocker]][[retired]]

Adeno was a star in the old era of BludBol and when BSEncef was building a team for the renaissance Adeno joined right in. They were mostly a roadblock in GCVI before retiring and getting replaced by modern blockers, but the team was thankful for their service, which continued in the street-level GCV Memorial tournament.
