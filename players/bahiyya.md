Bahiyya was one of the key players in the early modern-era Vagabond team. He was one of their top scorers in GCVII and generally played very well. When he was severely injured in GCVIII the Carcosan Tatters picked up his contract and rehabilitated him into a lesser version of himself, but one who could fit in with the Tatters system as a kicker and backup ball-handler when necessary. He retired after a severe injury against the Sump Runners in GCIX.
