# Aeson

[[badgerclaws]][[catcher]][[uci]][[gcviii]][[gcix]][[gcx]][[active]][[legend]]

Aeson was 0.58GSec old when he made his debut for the Badger Claws.

Aeson holds all sorts of records, including the best single match performance (of 8 TDs and MVP for 29 SPP, which is more than all but 14 players achieved in the first half of the GCX season). He then followed that up in the same season with a 9 TD match (plus MVP) for 32 SPP, eclipsing his own record.

Aeson came up in the UBBL Challenge with [[donat]]. In their first pro season the two had really similar records and both and the main difference between the two players has been one of durability. Aeson has peaked as a legendary player but remains healthy. It remained a weirdness of the business side of BludBol that Aeson was only just barely in the top 50 best paid players in the Pro Circuit until the massive financial readjustment happened in the post GCX off-season.
