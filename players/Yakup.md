Upon his retirement at the end of GCVIII Yakup had amassed 227 SPP with 178 SPP in Green Cup seasons VI-VIII. His final line score for Green Cup matches reads 55 TDs (+13 in the Open Division), 1 Completion, 0 Interceptions, 1 Casualty (0-1-0) and 2 MVP awards (+2 in the Open Division). The TD and SPP records were not, perhaps, unbreakable but they are pretty legendary.

Yakup was the first player to reach 100 SPP in the UBBL, and he did it in 20 matches with 0 MVP awards. It's kind of crazy that the fans didn't like this constant display of BludBol prowess. 

Yakup retired from pro BludBol at the end of GCVIII (652.4) but then returned for the GCV Memorial tournament in 683MSec, where he was killed due to a lack of medical facilities. He was only 0.618GSec old (~20yo).
