At her death (by crowdsurfing via [[Channing]] (DS)) Sabah was in 4th place on the Pro SPP list (199), 21 more than [[yakup]]. Sabah won fewer prizes, but carried her team on her back with a 27-5-16 W-D-L record. That's a 61% Win Percentage compared to the team's overall 50%. Her career ended at 5th all-time in rushing distance (806), and 1st in handoffs received (37).

Sabah was only player of the week one time (GCIX Week 9) but was a two-time all-star and by far the MVP of the Kaiju Dynamo.
