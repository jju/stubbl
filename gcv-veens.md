[[Veens]] took to the field with the [[filthytide]] for the first time in the Green Cup V Memorial tournament. She only played one match, snagging the ball and romping in for a short TD. It wasn't much to look at, but Asmodeus saw something there. Obviously he saw something. She didn't play again that tournament (which was not very exciting and doesn't have really good records).
