So you settle into the EDS to watch the {$followingTeam} play some bludbol. Their first match is against the Zensun Vagabonds.

The game is faster than you expected, and it's really hard to tell exactly what's going on. It looks like the feeds are just security footage from cameras suspended at weird angles over the field. Everything is washed out and blurry or overblown when the players end up just under a light. The team in the washed out orange and blue you figured out were the Tide players and you also figured out pretty quickly that they  and you assume there was some sort of scoring that happened, but without any explanation on the screen and barely any sound, the whole thing was weirdly unsatisfying.

Apparently the Carcosan Tatters won 1-0, though you had to look it up on the message boards afterwards. 

It sounds like these are going to be the most interesting players to watch, or at least the ones the message-boarders are most excited about.

* [[Adeno]] - Old-Era Veteran Blocker
* [[Dementia]] - Old-Era Veteran Blitzer
* [[MaskedPain]] - rookie Blitzer
* [[Pierre]] - Big Guy (started late?)

So that was a week of bludbol. The {$followingTeam} are 1-0-0. What now?

You watch 6 more weeks of terrible video-quality Carcosan Tatters bludbol on the EDS. Most of the time you have no idea what is going on, but it seems that you've picked a good team to follow (or at least a successful one).

They beat the Zensun Vagabonds 1-0 in week two, then had a 1-1 draw with the Old Wyrms in week 3. After another 1-0 win against the Filthy Tide, they started to score a bit more and got 2-1 wins against the Irregular Cogs and Glorious Hounds. You just finished watching them beat the Gore Farmers 1-0.

| Stacks | W-D-L | Outlands | W-D-L |
|-------|-----|--|--|
| Gore Farmers | 3-3-1 | Carcosan Tatters | 6-1-0 |
| Irregular Cogs | 6-2-6 | Filthy Tide | 3-1-3 |
| Old Wyrms | 5-2-7 | Zensun Vagabonds | 5-4-5 |
| Glorious Hounds | 2-1-4 | Ravenous Eagles | 5-2-7 |

Now there's word that another BludBol league is starting up in Stacksburg. Some of the other old-era teams that had been left out of this tournament are organizing to play for the "real" green cup.

The team you're following is 6-1-0. What now?

And that's the season.

The Tatters started off the second half with a 3-0 loss to the Irregular Cogs then scored the most you'd ever seen with a 3-0 win against the Old Wyrms. A grinding 1-0 loss to the Ravenous Eagles was followed by a 2-1 win against the Glorious Hounds. Then they had a big 4-0 loss to the Zensun Vagabonds, and a 2-1 loss to the Filthy Tide. A 3-0 win against the Gore Farmers finished off the season.
