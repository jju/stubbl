So you settle into the EDS to watch the {$followingTeam} play some bludbol. Their first match is against the Old Wyrms.

The game goes slower than you expected, and it's really hard to tell exactly what's going on. It looks like the feeds are just security footage from cameras suspended at weird angles over the field. Everything is washed out and blurry or overblown when the players end up just under a light. 

There were a lot of messy scrums and it looked like the ball was out on the ground a lot, maybe because of missed passes? Without any explanation on the screen and barely any sound, the whole thing was weirdly unsatisfying.

In the end the {$followingTeam} won 2-1, though you had to look it up on the message boards afterwards.

It sounds like these are going to be the most interesting players to watch, or at least the ones the message-boarders are most excited about.

* [[KneeMasher]] - Thrower
* [[Mashee]] - Catcher
* [[StoneLicker]] - Old-Era Veteran Blitzer



So that was a week of bludbol. The Gore Farmers are 1-0-0. What now?

You watch 6 more weeks of terrible video-quality {$followingTeam} bludbol on the EDS. Most of the time you have no idea what is going on.

They got a string of draws in the next few weeks: 1-1 with the Ravenous Eagles, 2-2 with the Zensun Vagabonds and 1-1 with the Irregular Cogs. Then they beat the Glorious Hounds 2-0 and the Filthy Tide 3-2 before getting their first loss against the Carcosan Tatters (the score was 1-0).

| Stacks | W-D-L | Outlands | W-D-L |
|-------|-----|--|--|
| Gore Farmers | 3-3-1 | Carcosan Tatters | 6-1-0 |
| Irregular Cogs | 6-2-6 | Filthy Tide | 3-1-3 |
| Old Wyrms | 5-2-7 | Zensun Vagabonds | 5-4-5 |
| Glorious Hounds | 2-1-4 | Ravenous Eagles | 5-2-7 |

Now there's word that another BludBol league is starting up in Stacksburg. Some of the other old-era teams that had been left out of this tournament are organizing to play for the "real" green cup.

The team you're following is 3-3-1. What now?

And that's the season.

The {$followingTeam} started off the second half with a 2-1 win over the Glorious Hounds, and then lost to the Zensun Vagabonds 3-2. They followed that up with a pair of 2-1 wins against the Old Wyrms and Filthy Tide, and a 3-2 win over the Ravenous Eagles. Their biggest loss of the season came next in a 5-1 drubbing by the Irregular Cogs, which was made even worse by the Carcosan Tatters beating them 3-0 in the final match of the regular season.

## standings

| Stacks | W-D-L | Outlands | W-D-L |
|-------|-----|--|--|
| Gore Farmers | 7-3-4 | Carcosan Tatters | 9-1-4 |
| Irregular Cogs | 6-2-6 | Filthy Tide | 6-2-6 |
| Old Wyrms | 5-2-7 | Zensun Vagabonds | 5-4-5 |
| Glorious Hounds | 3-4-7 | Ravenous Eagles | 5-2-7 |

At the end of the regular season the Gore Farmers had a W-D-L record of 7-3-4, which was good enough for first place in the Stacks. As the division winner they're awarded a 1-0 win against the Glorious Hounds in the Round of 16.
