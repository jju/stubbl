People. That's what you need if you're going to write anything worth reading. And where do you find people? Bugs'.

Bugs, of course, is not a course of food, but a former Colonial Guardsman and present proprietor/bartender in the heart of Stacksburg (a long trek from your cube out in the periphery such as it is).

He says he fought the xenomin back when they tried attacking the spire. Most people call bullshit on that story, since Bugs has never a) shown any inclination towards skills with violence b) left the Stacks. The invasion proper happened on one of the far spires, and no one can remember not seeing Bugs in his shitty little bar for long enough to have fought in a foreign war in distant lands. 

But he does have a big pincery head of something that looks an awful lot like one of the xenomin warriorpods mounted on the bar's wall. And no one really remembered Bugs making outlandish claims before that thing showed up. So yes. That's Bugs.

Back in the bad old days, Bugs found his bar getting blown up and shot through every couple of weeks by gangsters. It was a hub for lowlives. Now it's been a while and Bugs' got cleaned up when he found it would end up just outside the zone the colonials had expropriated for the mass elevator. The new Bugs' is the first bar outside the passenger arrival hall. Still a little dank, but the fixtures have a permanence that you don't get when you expect it all to be destroyed.

Bugs nods when you enter, even though it's been an "I thought you were dead" amount of time. Your scan of the room clocks more people than you remember, and not so rough. There are screens up, a lot more than you remember even from the last time.
