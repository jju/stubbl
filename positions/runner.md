The Runner is a position used as an alternative to a [[thrower]] in some playbooks, where long passing is not a big part of the gameplan. They often tend to be more fragile than their teammates, but don't get the major glory that someone like a [[catcher]] does. Outside of the Aardman playbook (which generally spreads the ball around a lot), runners can end up hogging a lot of the [[SPP]] or other offensive value.

Different playbooks can sometimes use different names for the position, which does make for a bit of variability.
