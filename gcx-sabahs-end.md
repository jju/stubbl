The crunch should have been audible if the camera was the sort that transmitted properly. But that wasn't what got her. She stayed by the sidelines and wobbled. And then the crowd got her. For at least a season now Sabah had been wobbly, needing to take a stand take a breath, and often enough to have cost her team wins. But she'd still been collecting wobbly wins.

Then the wobble took her into the crowd.

::the walls::

You see the hands grab her and at first it looks like they're trying to hold her up. If you hadn't watched BludBol before you'd think they were pushing her back onto the pitch. But that doesn't happen here. Once you hit the sidelines, you're out of the game, and out of the rules. The fans aren't bound by rules.

It's hard to tell why they allow these people such leeway. There should be better medical attention, more rules for the people watching a bloodsport. But there isn't that kind of protection, and you get the feeling that the commissioners don't want there to be any.

Would it get in the way?

::the scream::

It seems there are lots of screams. Again, the problem with these cameras means that nothing is transmitted except light. There appears to be a whole ancillary industry
