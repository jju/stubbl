Quite honestly, you got bored. Scores and names are all mashing together. The $team are in the lead, but apparently they aren't very good? It's hard to say.

Meanwhile, EDS is saying there's another BludBol league starting up. But they have the real trophy or something?

> These teams are boring. Maybe this new league will be better. I'll watch all these games. 
> I can watch both leagues from the comfort of my cubicle.
