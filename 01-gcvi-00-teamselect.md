All right. With no knowledge of anything regarding bludbol you can pull up a list of teams that will be playing in a couple of weeks.

All right. Bludbol is about scoring touchdowns and bashing the snot out of other teams.

You pull up the list of teams that will be playing in a couple of weeks. There are a bunch of excited people on your terminal arguing about who will obviously be the best this season, but really it's a bit of a wash.

After spending some time researching, you've got some notes on team playbooks (and styles of play those playbooks recommend).

After spending some time researching, you've got some notes on what these teams did the last time there was bludbol down in the Stacks. (The time after the Mass Elevator but before the Interruption is generally being called the old-era UBBL and they played four and a half Green Cups.)

So if you're going to be watching and following a team for, geez, 18 MSeconds, what kind of team do you want to spend time with?
[continue]
[if $research === 'basic']
The Ravenous Eagles' fans are pretty hyped up online, and the Gore Farmers' are pretty grouchy about who they're sharing a division with. But whatever.

The Ravenous Eagles' fans are pretty hyped up online, and the Gore Farmers' are pretty grouchy about who they're sharing a division with (it sounds like being surrounded by teams that are good at scoring might make life difficult). But whatever.

It's probably important to remember that the new teams bearing these names aren't coming back with old-school rosters, just whichever stars could be enticed.

[if $research === 'none']
It's hard to care just based on a name so you might as well choose randomly.

One thing jumping out at you is the Carcosan Tatters team name. Back before the mass elevator there was a Tatters gang. There must be a connection there, right?

Other than that, assuming those divisions are vaguely spatial, the Outlands teams are probably closer to your cube.
