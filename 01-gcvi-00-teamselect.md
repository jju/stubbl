All right. With no knowledge of anything regarding bludbol you can pull up a list of teams that will be playing in a couple of weeks. They're arranged in a couple of divisions: the Stacks and the Outlands.

Stacks

* Carcosan Tatters
* Filthy Tide
* Ravenous Eagles
* Zensun Vagabonds

In the Outlands

* Glorious Hounds
* Gore Farmers
* Irregular Cogs
* Old Wyrms

The first thing jumping out at you is the Carcosan Tatters team name. Back before the mass elevator there was a gang called that. There must be a connection there, right? Are they just mining nostalgia? But the gangland Tatters were full of mutants and creeps. This can't be the same bunch, can it?

Other than that, it's hard to care just based on a name so you might as well choose randomly. Assuming those divisions are vaguely spatial, the Outlands teams are probably closer to your cube.
