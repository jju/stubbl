BludBol bludbol bludbol. This shouldn't be too hard to find. They've been doing this uphive distraction for years down here now. You're sure that even back before the Interruption and closing of Bugs' for good, he was showing games on screens in there. You remember the flicker. They didn't have very good resolution. But there was something about a bunch of people together. They were getting into it. Of course they were, it was a spectacle designed to distract them from the way their lives had been violated using as many resources as could be mustered. No one had a chance. But that can't be the only way it all shakes out. 

There must be games happening out there. Didn't they build stadiums down here? When is the last time you left your cubicle? 

Of course, there's going to be BludBol on the EDS. You don't really need to leave your cube.

[Watch BludBol by yourself (with EDS).]
[Find an equivalent dive to Bugs and watch there.]
[Go see what's happening at one of the stadia.]

[unless passage.visits > 1]

Bugs' is no more. He used to move it but none of his old call-signs work. You're going to have to try somewhere else.

You end up at Fazel and Hiver's. It makes your stomach turn to look at the grotesque faux grit plastered all over. A dive bar that is held together with money. But it has screens and people wearing coloured shirts and gear, a big bunch in green and yellow and more in orange and blue ~~{reveal link: 'EDS', text: 'Old Wyrms and Filthy Tide colours, respectively.'}~~.

[else]

Back at Fazel and Hiver's. It may be corporate and terrible, but the screens work and you get a bit of a variety in fandoms.

[continue]

You settle in and watch a game

[if seasonTime === 1]

The Filthy Tide beat the team in pink ~~{reveal link: 'EDS', text: 'Kaiju Dynamo'}~~ and the Wyrms draw with their opponents ~~{reveal link: 'EDS', text: 'Cackling Furies'}~~.

[if seasonTime === 2]

The Wyrms beat a green and blue team ~~{reveal link: 'EDS', text: 'Badger Claws'}~~ 4-3. The Tide fans and the Wyrms fans seemed happy about this one, but the Tide lost their match to a team in black and gold ~~{reveal link: 'EDS', text: 'Carcosan Tatters'}~~.

[if seasonTime === 3]

The Tide got absolutely crushed by a team in blue and green ~~{reveal link: 'EDS', text: 'Zensun Vagabonds'}~~ and the fans are feeling pretty down. The Wyrms lost to the Gore Farmers ~~{reveal link: 'EDS', text: 'in orange and black'}~~ so there was some commiserating. It felt like there were a few Farmers fans hanging around in the bar too, but they didn't seem like they were gloating.

[if seasonTime === 4]

The Tide lost to a team in red and blue ~~{reveal link: 'EDS', text: 'Irregular Cogs'}~~ and the fans are feeling pretty down. The Wyrms tied their match with the Kaiju Dynamo.

[if seasonTime === 5]

The Tide lost to a team in red and white ~~{reveal link: 'EDS', text: 'TC Sump Runners'}~~ and the fans are feeling pretty down. The Wyrms tied their match with the Vagabonds, escaping without any terrible injuries.

At this point you've watched a third of the season and both the Filthy Tide and the Old Wyrms are not doing so hot overall. Though the Wyrms are second place in the Stacks division, they only have one win and three draws, while the Tide have 4 losses to go with their lone win.~~{reveal link: 'EDS', text: 'The Carcosan Tatters are the top of the league with W-D-L 3-1-1.'}~~ 

A little after the Wyrms match wraps up, a gaggle of hivers in orange and black pile in in a raucous mood. The Gore Farmers won their game against the Spectres and these ones at least
