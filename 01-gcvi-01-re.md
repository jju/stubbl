So you settle into the EDS to watch the {$followingTeam} play some bludbol. Their first match is against the Carcosan Tatters.

The game goes slower than you expected, and it's really hard to tell exactly what's going on. It looks like the feeds are just security footage from cameras suspended at weird angles over the field. Everything is washed out and blurry or overblown when the players end up just under a light. 

There were a lot of messy scrums and it looked like the ball was out on the ground a lot, maybe because of missed passes? Without any explanation on the screen and barely any sound, the whole thing was weirdly unsatisfying.

In the end the {$followingTeam} lost 1-0, though you had to look it up on the message boards afterwards.

It sounds like these are going to be the most interesting players to watch, or at least the ones the message-boarders are most excited about.

* [[Chikondi]] - Blitzer
* [[Percy]] - Heavy
* [[Twig]] - Old-Era Veteran Line

So that was a week of bludbol. The {$followingTeam} are 0-0-1. What now?

You watch 6 more weeks of terrible video-quality {$followingTeam} bludbol on the EDS. Most of the time you have no idea what is going on.

They got a 1-1 draw against the Gore Farmers in week 2, then lost 4-1 against the Filthy Tide and 2-1 against the Zensun Vagabonds before a pair of tight 2-1 wins over the Old Wyrms and Irregular Cogs. They ended the first half of the season with a 3-1 loss to the Glorious Hounds.

| Stacks | W-D-L | Outlands | W-D-L |
|-------|-----|--|--|
| Gore Farmers | 3-3-1 | Carcosan Tatters | 6-1-0 |
| Irregular Cogs | 2-2-3 | Filthy Tide | 3-1-3 |
| Old Wyrms | 2-2-3 | Ravenous Eagles | 2-1-4 |
| Glorious Hounds | 2-1-4 | Zensun Vagabonds | 1-3-3 |

Now there's word that another BludBol league is starting up in Stacksburg. Some of the other old-era teams that had been left out of this tournament are organizing to play for the "real" green cup.

The team you're following is 2-1-4 and none of these players are in any prize consideration. What now?

And that's the season.

The {$followingTeam} started off the second half with a 2-0 win over the Old Wyrms, then were handed a 4-1 loss by the Filthy Tide. They got a 1-0 win over the Carcosan Tatters before losing 3-1 to the Irregular Cogs and 3-2 to the Gore Farmers. The Eagles managed a 2-1 win over the Zensun Vagabonds and te regular season ended in a 1-1 draw with the Glorious Hounds.

## standings

| Stacks | W-D-L | Outlands | W-D-L |
|-------|-----|--|--|
| Gore Farmers | 7-3-4 | Carcosan Tatters | 9-1-4 |
| Irregular Cogs | 6-2-6 | Filthy Tide | 6-2-6 |
| Old Wyrms | 5-2-7 | Zensun Vagabonds | 5-4-5 |
| Glorious Hounds | 3-4-7 | Ravenous Eagles | 5-2-7 |

At the end of the regular season the Ravenous Eagles had a W-D-L record of 5-2-7, which was only good for last place in the Outlands. As the last-place team they're awarded a 1-0 loss against the Carcosan Tatters in the first round of the playoffs, depressing their official record even further.
