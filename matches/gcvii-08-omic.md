* Green Cup VII - 8 - **Orbital Machine** 2 Irregular Cogs 1

This match, known as The Betrayal at Dungardin, will be under review by BludBol scholars for quite some time and I wouldn't be surprised if there were legal proceedings. The first half was lacklustre, involving a trading of TDs and a number of ill-advised passes. The interesting thing is the lack of blocks and blitzes by either team. The most obvious were taken, but no real sacking attempts.

The second half was where things went weird. Both teams were basically playing games of monkey in the middle, with no urgency or attempts to score or injure. There was obvious collusion taking place and it was easy to see why. If both teams came out of the match with a draw then they would be atop their divisions and their records would remain identical until some presumable final meetup.

But it all fell apart on the very last possession when Heep was near the endzone and received another very risky pass. And then he bolted for the TD and won. So the Cogs have a new arch-nemesis. They can't say the Machine went back on a deal, because the deal would have been illegal and might result in some major sanctions. But they got betrayed in the very moment they couldn't do anything about it in the game. And because of the divisional structure the next time these two teams could meet would be the Green Cup final (or next season). Oof.

PoM: Heep 6 SPP (including Cp, Int, TD hat trick)
