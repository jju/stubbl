# Machine vs Sump Runners

#t2772.4

Pick: Even

How will the bad teams do in GCXI? The Machine are kind of a dark horse for the season, but the Sump Runners are probably going to be terrible. This match was injury-filled, but in the end the Machine tied it up, which the Sump Runners aren't too unhappy with. OM 2 - SR 2

[[Kendrick]] wanted a TD at least but got his hip smashed instead. Rookie [[jarm]] got a completion to put him on his way to being a bit more useful, while the other rookie got her career ended. [[uli]] was largely ineffective. The Sump Runners managed their lineup, tangling the huge Blockers of the Machine with relatively unskilled labour, letting [[jacquetta]] have a very nice match.

So you watched a bludbol match. The two teams, the Orbital Machine and the Sump Runners didn't make the game look very exciting[ifScreen], but that may have just been your feed. It was difficult to tell what exactly was going on on your screen, but the crowd did do some roaring.[else] but you were witness to a lot of emotion in the stands. The Sump Runner fans who were mostly wearing red were super loud and ready to drop bricks on anyone they could find in black and grey, which were actually not very abundant despite it being in what you assumed was Machine territory.[continue]
