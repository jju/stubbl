# Spectres vs Fatality

#t2774.8

Pick: EF

Now that's what we'd expect these Spectres to look like. A 5-0 trouncing seemed like the sort of thing they'd been escaping a little too easily thus far in the season, but the Fatality asserted themselves as being done with the failures of GCX and are well on their way to their surprising first goal of the season: a trip to the Champions Circuit. DS 0 - EF 5
