# Farmers vs Runners

#t2786.1

Pick: Runners

The Runners might be able to play spoilers against the Spectres in Week 15 but this match's loss to the Farmers' nobodies was entirely meaningless. Except for [[vaso]]. The Farmers took advantage of the lack of urgency in the match to give another pile of rookies a shot to make an impression. None of them did, but now they can say they played in the Green Cup (and even won).

> Weather: Nice
> Toss: SR-Receive
> Kickoffs: GF-GettheRef (SR 1), SR-HighKick (GF 1Half), SR-CheeringFansGF (GF 2), GF-PerfectDefense (Final)
