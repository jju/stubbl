# Tide vs Menace

#t2772.6

Pick: Menace

On Venus' second TD of the match Briselda made a beautiful blocking run after the Menace got a perfect defens off the kick, drawing both Blitzers away from the speedster and tying up Georgina's route for trying to make the interception. It doesn't show up in the scoresheet but that was beautiful. Late in the second half Venus stumbled on a TD dash but the long play for the Menace went awry near the Tide's endzone and the chain of possession sent Septimus to the endzone for the winning TD. FT 6 - AM 5
