# Cogs vs Tatters

#t2786.7

Pick: Cogs

The Tatters picked up the win that could put them in the mix for the Division title (with a few more losses by the Menace and Cogs) but the big news is how [[Merlyn]] died tripping over himself trying to stop the Tatters from taking a 2-0 lead into halftime. It didn't work and that puts the Cogs' postseason hopes to bed even if they get the Division title.
