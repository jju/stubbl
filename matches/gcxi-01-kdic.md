# Dynamo vs Cogs

#t2772.7

Pick: Even

The Dynamo got off to a good start, putting the Cogs out of their comfort zone and not letting their aggro defence get settled in early. But the Dynamo couldn't really get their own offense clicking over smoothly and the Cogs walked away with this one. KD 1 - IC 2

You always like seeing the winner of the toss elect not to receive. The Cogs are better when they're on defense anyway and keeping them out of that role as long as possible is probably for the best. But the Cogs played like they are as good as they think they are and even afterwards the Dynamo couldn't get them out of their rhythm.
