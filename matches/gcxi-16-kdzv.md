The edge here is definitely for the Dynamo. They scored more, allowed fewer TDs, and inflicted more casualties. The question is what is the path the Vagabonds could take to get the win?

The Vagabonds are a much better passing team than the Dynamo, so this is how they're going to have a better chance to attack.

More Vagabonds touch the ball, which makes sense as they are a more passing-heavy team. More touches mean more chances for things to go wrong, so minimizing mistakes will be key.

The Dynamo inflict more casualties than the Vagabonds, but a lot of that is due to throwing a lot more blocks out there. If the Vagabonds can convert their sacks into possessions they've got a chance at the upset.

In their last match (last week) both teams didn't really have their hearts in it. [[Ion]] was the Dynamo's leading rusher and she did not make the playoff roster. In that match the Vagabonds completed only one pass, which is not how they want this one to go.

The Vagabonds lined up with an overloaded right flank approach. [[Dinh]] led the charge after [[Padma]] who opened up a hole right through the line of blockers after a thrown rock benefitted the Vagabonds.  The Dynamo slowed the tempo down and didn't try a long flashy end to end in one dash move but because of that [[Marco]] got hurt while waiting as the outlet to keep the Vagabond defense honest. They burst the ball free and [[Louis]] deftly made his way to the end zone for the TD. KD 1 - ZV 0

Everyone who'd been knocked out on the opening drive made it back for the second, and this time the Vagabonds took a more balanced approach. They caged up and [[Betuel]] calmly passed to [[Mia]] in traffic who made her way to the end zone knocking down a runner as she went. KD 1 - ZV 1

There was bobbling on the pickup after the kick, which meant the Dynamo didn't fully commit to the scoring lightning attack on the flank. But because the ref had put some extra time on the clock they actually could benefit from a more measured approach. That [[Tijmen]] gave [[Zaira]] a fractured skull when the Vagabonds tried to corral the ball-handlers was just a bonus. Then [[Vardan]] muffed the pass to [[Fidolio]] that was supposed to get them the lead. [[Mia]] busted through on the Vagabonds right flank and [[Alphege]] grabbed the ball and tried to get it downfield to her, but bollocksed it up. After a couple more tries [[Vardan]] did get the ball to [[Fidolio]] who danced into the endzone to end the first half. KD 2 - ZV 1

At halftime both teams were playing about as expected and the Dynamo's lead felt legit. They were receiving the kick and could now play the conservative defensive option if they wished. With Zaira hurt, the Vagabonds had to go small and skilled on defence to try and steal a TD. A thrown rock took [[Hamza]] out of the Heavy's replacement spot in the line. The Dynamo took advantage to build a cage which the Vagabonds failed to break ([[Alphege]] tried to be the hero but landed on his face) and [[Vardan]] got the ball to steady [[Fidolio]] for the TD. KD 3 - ZV 1

The Vagabonds went back with a balanced offense to try and force their way back into this game. There was lots of time on the clock but letting the Dynamo pad their lead would be disastrous. They advanced up the left flank and calmly calmly passed to [[Mia]], doing what they had to to claw back into contention. KD 3 -ZV 2

Now the pressure was on. The Vagabonds needed to force a turnover and score off it. They lined up wider than before to free up more blitzers for sack patrol. When [[Vardan]] tried to pass to [[Fidolio]] instead of the more sure handed catcher [[Louis]], Fidolio bobbled the ball and the Vagabonds had their opening! [[Clydon]] knocked the ball into the crowd, who dumped it back into Vagabond territory where [[Betuel]] calmly partially caged up and [[Padma]] headed downfield and [[Breann]] [[Hamza]] and [[Everette]] tried to hold the line. While they got flattened Betuel rolled left, passed downfield to Padma who made her catch in traffic and blasted her way out to the endzone to tie things up. KD 3 - ZV 3

And now we get into the final quarter of the match. Not quite in the next-score takes it, but close. The Vagabonds lined up identically to the previous drive. [[Louis]] had been knocked out on the previous drive and was replaced with [[Oliwer]]. The Dynamo were out of tricks and were going to have to rely entirely on their players' skills the rest of the way out, but the cheering fans boosted [[Tijmen]] at least a bit. [[Deepali]] opened the hole on the flank and the pickup and handoff went smoothly. The Dynamo line advanced and grappled with as many Vagabonds as they could trying desperately to keep the attack safe. They kept the most dangerous ones at bay and Deepali opened another hole for [[Fidolio]]. [[Clydon]] had the chance to make a daring diving tackle and used it. The ball hit the sidelines and got a favourable bounce to a place where [[Betuel]] could scoop it up and pass to [[Padma]] who only had the fragile [[Starfin]] in range to stop her. [[Hamza]] escaped the line and tried to tie up that last safety, who couldn't dodge away and Padma scored, completing the upset in grand style! KD 3 - ZV 4
