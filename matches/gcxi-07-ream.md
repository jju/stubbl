# Eagles vs Menace

#t2779.8

Pick: Menace

Vusala got too aggressive to prove herself on defense and wound up leaping into a smashed knee. The Eagles played out the rest of the first half caging and being methodical, but in the dying moments it was like so many other times this season [[donato]] who got the TD and tied it up. Then in the second half the carnage began. Kropotkin and Susila both killed while Laurel ran for her life. The Eagles scored and the Menace managed with a severely depleted lineup to get the ball to Laurel who at least got the draw for the team that lost so much.
