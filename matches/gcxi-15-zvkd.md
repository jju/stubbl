# Vagabonds vs Dynamo

#t2787.4

Pick: Dynamo

These two teams have a long history with the Dynamo's sole loss being in the GCX Division Finals. The Vagabonds didn't really care about overturning that record this match as long as it holds they meet up in the GCXI playoffs. The lineups look to be quite different in a week or two.
