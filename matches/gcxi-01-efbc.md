# Fatality vs Claws

#t2772.2

Pick: Claws

The Claws had the edge going in against a Fatality team that was terrible last season and has no resources to build up something much better this season unless they win a lot of games. [[Rong]] got badly hurt on the opening drive which can't be good for their development plans. At the half Rong had been joined by a chunk of the line fodder on the sidelines and the Fatality were up 2-1. They never released that lead.

Remembering how much Sabah meant to the league made looking at Aeson for this season's big story a pretty easy choice. The problem came in when you were scanning the pitch at the beginning of the match and Aeson was nowhere to be found. After some checking in the feeds, you realize that the Badger Claws weren't putting their biggest star out there to start the season. Your planned story hook might be finished. On the flip side, they've got a rookie (Rong) lining up to take the star's place. Maybe there's something there.
