# Fatality vs Claws

#t2772.2

Pick: Claws

The Claws had the edge going in against a Fatality team that was terrible last season and has no resources to build up something much better this season unless they win a lot of games. [[Rong]] got badly hurt on the opening drive which can't be good for their development plans. At the half Rong had been joined by a chunk of the line fodder on the sidelines and the Fatality were up 2-1. They never released that lead.
