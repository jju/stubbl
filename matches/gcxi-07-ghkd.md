# Hounds vs Dynamo

#t2779.9

Pick: Even

The Dynamo are bringing in a bunch of scrubs to take on the Hounds in this divisional battle. It's a weird move. The whole match was about the Hounds' lesser players showing off against the Dynamo's nobodies. It meant [[ziba]] only got one touchdown but [[Ravil]] got some decent reps in.
