# Hounds vs Tatters

#t2772.5

Pick: Hounds

The Hounds are coming off a tournament win and are looking to show off against one of their arch-rivals. The Tatters lined up specifically to deny [[Ziba]] an easy endzone path but a rock from the crowd stunned [[OreSmitingMaster]] and the path was made clear, but [[Oxana]] couldn't complete her pass. The Tatters made things difficult, but Ziba did end up scoring on the drive.
