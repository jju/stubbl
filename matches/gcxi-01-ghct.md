# Hounds vs Tatters

#t2772.5

Pick: Hounds

The Hounds are coming off a tournament win and are looking to show off against one of their arch-rivals. The Tatters lined up specifically to deny [[ziba]] an easy endzone path but a rock from the crowd stunned [[OreSmitingMaster]] and the path was made clear, but [[Oxana]] couldn't complete her pass. The Tatters made things difficult, but Ziba did end up scoring on the drive.

Looking at these teams play, even as a relative newb to BludBol you can see the difference in approach. The Glorious Hounds are trying to throw the ball in arcing passes while the Carcosan Tatters try to smother everything. You watch the Hounds try to use their swagger to blow things open but it never really gels for them. Maybe there's something about nobility of failure to be written here?
