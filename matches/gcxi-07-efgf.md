# Fatality vs Farmers

#t2779.5

Pick: Fatality

Weird fact: the Fatality have never played in the Gore Farmers' stadium.

After the first half in which the Fatality never let up control, there was a glimmer that the Farmers could pull it back. It was for naught though. The Fatality maintain their tournament win streak.
