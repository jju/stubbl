# Dynamo vs Wyrms

#t2778.8

Pick: Wyrms

Elvis only needed 2 completions in this match to surpass [[yosif]] as the all-time Green Cup passing leader. He did not get them, as the Dynamo hung onto the ball the entire second half without even scoring, making for a bit of a boring match, but a safe win that the Dynamo have often been loathe to try for.

the Wyrms need to start overachieving and they have the skills to do it
