# Vagabonds vs Fatality

#t2775.5

Pick: Vagabonds (!?)

The Vagabonds are severely bashed up after their last match, which makes the SpreadZone pick for them to be the ones to end the Fatality's win streak all the more baffling. The Vagabonds did make a good match out of it though, and took out a couple of the Fatality's support players permanently, which will have an impact as the season wears on.

the rise of the Fatality especially against a team that's trying to make a bit of money

### playoff race

EF pretty much assured of a Champions Circuit spot so this will be a bit relaxed.
