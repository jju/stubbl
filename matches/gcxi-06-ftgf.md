# Tide vs Farmers

#t2778.7

Pick: Tide

A nice comeback match for Venus after the disappointment that was the Champions Circuit. She could have been badly hurt in the first half but she forced her way back into the match not letting anyone play it safe with her health. The Farmers made it close late with a perfect defense to keep Venus tied up, but in the final moments of a tied up game the Tide got the ball to their legend and they won. The Gore Farmers aren't too worried about the loss as they're still up two wins over the Sump Runners, which means the playoffs are almost a certainty.
