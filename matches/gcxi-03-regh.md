# Eagles vs Hounds

Pick: Hounds

The Eagles beat the odds by crunching through an interminable match. The Hounds attempted to force things in the second half and to make a long-distance attack to expand the lead in the final quarter, but the Eagles managed to get the ball to the endzone and all we got was a draw. RE 1 - GH 1
