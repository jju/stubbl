# Dynamo vs Farmers

#t2782.7

Pick: Dynamo+

These teams are very even, historically, apart from the Farmers winning two Green Cups. But even rivalry mode didn't trigger a change in the Farmers' lineup construction, opting for playoff depth rather than a win-now approach. The Dynamo were just better in this match and got some good work out of [[Erika]] to claim the win and stay on top of the Heaps.
