# Spectres vs Farmers

#t2772.1 

Pick: Spectres

It is crazy that spreadZone were giving odds in favour of the Spectres winning this match. No seriously, what are you thinking? Give the Gore Farmers credit though, they fielded a strong lineup. The Farmers are never great for a quote but [Sky Tripper](../players/skytripper) [[skytripper]] said they were just trying to win and he wouldn't be baited into commentary on the team's tanky tendencies in the past. You could barely tell who was who in the Spectres' half of the field.

Farmers got a nice and easy TD and then pushed the rookie [[melite]] out of bounds as ball carrier, effectively ending the drive. [[RockLobber]] got badly hurt by the freebooting chainsaw wielding maniac. [Gojko](../players/gojko) [[gojko]]'s botched pickup off the kick wasn't immediately harmful, but [Zdravko](../players/zdravko) [[zdravko]] botched the catch on the try-again pass. [Aemulus](../players/aemulus) [[aemulus]] smashed the rookie [[melite]]'s hip closing the trap on the left-hand drive the Spectres had been trying, but then Gojko busted loose and Zdravko shovelled it back to him and they were down the right side and tying it up with only a quarter of the match remaining. [[Aethelraed]] got a gouged eye and will be sitting out against the Wyrms in Week 2. But the Farmers stayed cool and [[Ros]] got the ball to Aemulus who partnered up with [[Sylvester]] for protection (which they needed as Gojko made a last-ditch attack on the ball) as they ran down the clock. DS 1 - GF 2

Before this match the Spectres had announced they were actually serious about the lineup they were going to field. You tried to get the skinny on what was really going on but no one in the Spectres' front office would return your messages. In the end they performed a bit better than expected but the Gore Farmers used their stars to win as they should have.
