# Fatality vs Hounds

#t2790.9

Pick: Hounds

The regular season overall leaders Eldritch Fatality (2080TV) are the underdogs in the Classic Conference Final against the Glorious Hounds (2310TV), which seems surprising.

| Glorious Hounds   | Green Cup XI |   11 |    4 | **2** |    17 | 76.4706 |   76 |   46 |   4.4706 |   2.7059 |   14 |    0.8235 |    -14 |    0 |

The Fatality had the most wins on the season but the Hounds had the fewest losses giving them an identical Win%. The Fatality defense is better, but holy smokes that Hounds offense! Best in the league.

The Hounds were the top-passing team of the season (one of the top 5 season performances in the modern era), and threw only one interception. That aerial game will probably get more screentime in this match.

| Eldritch Fatality | Green Cup XI |     193 |     877 |   49 | 17.8980 |       3.94 |

The Hounds scored way more TDs and were far more direct about it, but that's to be expected when the Fatality like to be tricky with their defense.

The Fatality throw a lot more blocks out there, but the Hounds are actually more effective with their blocking, and have more sacks.

The Fatality were crushed the last time they met this season in the final week [[gcxi-15-efgh]] so they are hoping their defense holds up better in playoff time.

> Weather: Nice
> Toss: GH-Receive
> Kickoffs: EF-Blitz (EF 1), EF-HighKick (GH 1), GH-RiotLong (EF 2Half), GH-Blitz (GH 2), GH-BrilliantCoachingBoth (EF 3), EF-BrilliantCoachingEF (GH 3Regulation), EF-ThrowaRockEF ()

The Fatality kicked to the Hounds and blitzed. Exactly the wrong way for [[Ziba]] to get her head in the game. But even with Ziba being swarmed she didn't go down, and [[Oxana]] went with the gameplan. [[Betul]] made the interception and ran it back for a TD putting the Hounds off their game immediately. EF 1 - GH 0

On the next kick things went to plan and [[Ziba]] scored easily. EF 1 - GH 1

The Fatality sent [[Koralo]] up the right but Irenaeus attacked and got the ball out to Cecile who made the long pass to Udo, but [[Beatrix]] caught up with her and made the sack. [[Oxana]] couldn't handle the ball afterwards and the Fatality took control. From there they played a risky game for the rest of the half, holding the ball without scoring so as not to give Ziba another chance to strikle. After a number of sacks and dumps the tactic paid off and Koralo scored as the half ended. EF 2 - GH 1

Starting the second half the Hounds suprised everyone with a blitz of their own. It didn't produce iummediate results but eventually Oxana got the ball to [[Ziba]] to tie up the match. EF 2 - GH 2

Huguo faltered in opening up the flank attack off the next kick, and [[Florinda]] piled in to take [[Koralo]] out of the rest of the match. But [[Filipa]] got the ball to [[Betul]] and the Hounds had huge difficulties getting players back to harass her and she stepped across the line to take the lead. EF 3 - GH 2

Now the Hounds had the chance to tie the game and force OT. This was what [[Ziba]]'s entire playstyle is based on, this moment. The Fatality switched up their defensive posture to try and close off holes for Ziba to sneak through. It didn't work and Ziba did her job. EF 3 - GH 3

The lineup was the same as moments before. [[Florinda]] opened up the same hole for [[Ziba]] but [[Oxana]] botched the pickup! There was a series of scrambles before [[Cecile]] grabbed the ball and made the pass to [[Ziba]] who made the catch and won the game. The Glorious Hounds are Green Cup bound. EF 3 - GH 4 (OT)
