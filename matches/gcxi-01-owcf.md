# Wyrms vs Furies

#t2772.9

Pick: OW

The Old Wyrms are prohibitive favourites on the season. Can they be even more dominant than they were in GCIX? Not according to this match! The Furies kept the Wyrms under control and got a draw, which is way more than they were expected. The Wyrms can't be happy with that. OW 2 - CF 2

The Wyrms are the team that's won the last two Green Cups, so they must be pretty great right? You didn't really see a lot of that in this match. The Furies played a slow game and attacked the Wyrms players as much as they could. It was hard to see a lot of amazing skill out there on the field today.
