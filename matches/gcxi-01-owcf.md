# Wyrms vs Furies

#t2772.9

Pick: OW

The Old Wyrms are prohibitive favourites on the season. Can they be even more dominant than they were in GCIX? Not according to this match! The Furies kept the Wyrms under control and got a draw, which is way more than they were expected. The Wyrms can't be happy with that. OW 2 - CF 2
