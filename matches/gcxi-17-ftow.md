# Tide vs Wyrms

#t2789.5

Pick: Wyrms

The Filthy Tide (2330TV) won the division but despite coming in second in the regular season they are still being pitched as the underdogs this round against the Old Wyrms (2490TV).

The Tide had a great season, but as we know, the playoffs mean one bad day can end it quickly.

The Wyrms passed more and were better at their passing than the Tide, who tended to use far more handoffs to get the ball to [[Venus]]

Here we can see how the running game was the Tide's only real strategy this season. With Venus' injury in week 15 we may need to see a reevaluation of that.

The two teams at the bottom of the casualty standings so we shouldn't expect a lot of blood on the field.

In their last match in week 7 [[gcxi-07-ftow]] the Tide won and ended the career of the Wyrms' legendary thrower [[Elvis]]. There could be some payback on its way from the defending champions.

> Weather: Very Sunny

> Kickoffs: FT-QuickSnap (OW 1), OW-ChangingWeatherNice (FT 1), FT-CheeringFansFT (Half), OW-HighKick (OW 2), OW-CheeringFansFT (FT 2), FT-PerfectDefence (FT 3), FT-PitchInvasion (Final)

The lights were bright and the Tide claimed to have reworked their techniques for the playoffs to show some new looks. They got off a deep kick, and then [[Jia]] messed up their very first pass attempt. But they recovered even with [[Venus]] putting pressure on, and got the ball down to [[Amador]] for a TD. FT 0 - OW 1

The Tide lined up in a familiar overload formation but instead of having [[Venus]] as the beneficiary, [[Milica]] was there. But the best laid plans went awry when [[Geir]] botched the pickup. The Wyrms pressed and [[Seosamh]] made the play for the TD. He had the ball stripped and [[Aleksy]] got the ball out of danger and up to [[Venus]] who dashed forward and had the presence of mind to stick with the original plan and hand off to [[Milica]], who drew the sack attempt from [[Rati]] and dished the ball back to [[Venus]]. After the predictable mobbing by the Wyrms, [[Venus]] leapt free and got her TD to tie the match up. It took more time than they'd expected but playing it cool worked wonders. FT 1 - OW 1

Two serious injuries already and the Tide were using their entire lineup, which they needed to keep the Wyrms off the scoreboard and head into halftime tied up. FT 1 - OW 1

[[Milica]] didn't stay safe as the Tide attempted to take the lead and the turnover cost them dearly. FT 1 - OW 2

On the next attempt they managed it better and it was [[Kelemann]] who leapt into danger pushing things too hard. [[Aleksy]] recovered and got it to [[venus]] who did the [[Milica]] handoff again and then caught it back to leap out and score. FT 2 - OW 2

The Wyrms rolled out a standard flank assault, but responded to the Tide's perfect defence by switching sides. It was enough to force a mistake. Aleksy managed to get the ball and passed to Venus, who missed the catch. [[Jia]] grabbed the ball and prepared for the long pass to score the winning TD, but wasn't paying attention and stumbled! [[Venus]] grabbed the ball herself and calmly scored. FT 3 - OW 2

The calm was only in [[Venus]]' head, as the home crowd stormed the pitch celebrating their champions of the Stacks. FT 3 - OW 2
