# Wyrms vs Tatters

#t2784.7

Pick: Wyrms

The Wyrms have only beaten the Tatters once in ten seasons, but SpreadZone thinks this'll be the second. They thought wrong. The Tatters did a patented smother and control match and put a lot of pressure on the Badger Claws to right their ship if they want to give their speedstaers a taste of playoff action.
