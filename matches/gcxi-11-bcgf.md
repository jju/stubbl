# Claws vs Farmers

#t2783.4

Pick: Claws+

The Claws had the setup exactly as they needed it. Sure the first half didn't see them exit with a lead, but they jumped on a defensive TD to open the second and had last touch; they could keep a win in the cards the whole way down. And then even with a quick snap [[Klim]] got the jump and barely needed to do anything to make it all work and he tripped on the endzone line. Woof.

the Claws are sucking and need to pick it up horse with broken leg, but the Farmers have a playoff spot locked so there isn't much urgency there.
