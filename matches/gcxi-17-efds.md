# Fatality vs Spectres

#t2789.9

Pick: Fatality

The Eldritch Fatality (2050TV) are favoured to beat the Darkling Spectres (2390TV), but that may not be taking into account the short-handedness of the Pits Champions.

No one expected the Spectres to be this good this season. Especially with the lineup they rolled out for the first two-thirds of the campaign.

The Spectres are better casualty inflicters than the Fatality and with the Eldritch team playing with a short lineup (only 10 players ended up being eligible for the playoffs) this is where they are going to have to strike, and strike early.

The Fatality cruised to a win the last time they met this season [[gcxi-03-dsef]], but the Spectres' lineup was vastly different.

> Weather: Blizzard
> Toss: EF-Kick
> Kickoffs: EF-ThrowaRockEF (EF 1)), EF-GettheRef (EF 2), EF-CheeringFansDS (EF 3Half), DS-HighKick (EF 4), EF-RiotLong (Final)

The weather was terrible and the kick was touchbacked to [[Sacnicte]] who headed carefully up the sidelines. [[Ayane]] got back for the sack and retrieved the ball. [[Ayane]] was sacked in turn and [[Channing]] tried to get the ball back to [[Sacincte]].  [[Betul]] couldn't intercept the pass but it was errant anyway. [[Koralo]] picked it up, got the ball to [[Filipa]] who then took off in the ice for a downfield [[Beatrix]]. [[Ross]] couldn't get away from [[Huguo]] to stop her and the first TD was recorded. EF 1 - DS 0

The kick for the second drive was short but [[Zdravko]] couldn't haul it in. After some fumbling around [[Ilanit]] was heading endzonewards, but Channing got the ball loose and Ross passed it up to Sacnicte for another sideline run. She was sacked and the ball got out to Koralo who Channing tried to sack but couldn't get away from her markers and got badly hurt in the process. Filipa and Betul then connected for the long TD in the ice. EF 2 - DS 0

The visiting crowd roared for the Spectres, but they were missing almost all their main ball-handlers. Ross was pressed into Catcher duty and Persis came in to guide the offense, but he couldn't handle the ice on his way to pick up the kick. Beatrix recovered it and scored again to close down the first half. EF 3 - DS 0

The Fatality received the kick to start the second half with some smooth play, but [[Koralo]] couldn't dump-off successfully and [[Ross]] swooped in to grab the ball. And start the comeback? Nope. [[Ayane]] got the ball back and Filipa connected with Koralo to head for a score to widen the lead even more. There was a little bit of drama on the run, but eventually Koralo made it. EF 4 - DS 0

The Fatality crowd were ecstatic and needed to be restrained. The Fatality didn't score again and the Spectres fouled [[Ayane]] but nothing happened to change the outcome. EF 4 - DS 0
