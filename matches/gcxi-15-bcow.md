# Claws vs Wyrms

#t2787.2

Pick: Tide

The Wyrms and Claws met in the Conference Finals in the previous two Green Cups and the Wyrms won both of them. With the Claws being eliminated this year, and this likely being Aeson's final game does it change how things go? 

Yes it did. Aeson and Klim put on a fantastic score-filled show for the Claws faithful, and while they didn't put the Wyrms in any lineup construction danger, they put enough hurt in that the Wyrms won't forget the match.
