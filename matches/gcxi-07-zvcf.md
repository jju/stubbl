# Vagabonds vs Furies

#t2779.3

Pick: Vagabonds

After a three vs four Classic cross division match we get a four vs three. These teams have met in the playoffs three times and the Furies have the edge. This could be seen as a pride game. [[Green]] is also starting for the Vagabonds and they are expecting big things. She got the opening (defensive) TD which bodes well for her Vagabonds future. But [[Svyatopolk]] then mangled her in midfield,and the doctors say she won't ever be as quick as she was. The Furies then took over in the second half and tied it up also on defensive alignments.
