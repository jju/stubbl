# Eagles vs Farmers

#t2775.8

Pick: Eagles slight

The Eagles got the win in a slugfest that didn't accomplish much beyond inching Ekua towards the pro Games Played record. It's hard to see the draw of these lineups, and the Eagles would have to be pretty lucky to actually make the Champions Circuit on the back of play like this.
