# Hounds vs Vagabonds

#t2780.1


Pick: Hounds+

[[Mia]] killed by the crowd off the opening kick, but got rushed into the medical wing to get out on the field again. Which was good as she scored on the next drive. That was the last good thing that happened for the Vagabonds, who got dismantled through the rest of the match.
