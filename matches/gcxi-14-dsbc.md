# Spectres vs Claws

#t2786.5

Pick: Claws

Both teams need this win, but the Spectres have an opening if they fail. The Claws are bringing in Aeson to make the most of their last gasp at the playoffs.

The Badger Claws couldn't get it together to pull off a win and they have missed the playoffs for the first time since entering Green Cup level play. The Spectres have clinched nothing but do have the edge in Week 15.
