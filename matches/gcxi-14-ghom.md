# Hounds vs Machine

#t2786.4

Pick: Hounds+

The Machine need to win this and the next one (with a Vagabonds loss) to sneak into the postseason. The Hounds need this win to retake the lead in the Heaps to get that all-important bye.

The Machine spent the first half falttening everyone on the field (and got a TD and the lead), winnowing the Hounds down to 6 for the second half. Unfortunately for them Ziba was one of the 6 and promptly scored off the kick to open the second. That proved enough to hang onto the draw and eliminate the Machine from the GCXI playoffs.
