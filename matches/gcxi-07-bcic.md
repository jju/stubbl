# Claws vs Cogs

#t2779.4

Pick: Claws

This is most likely a playoff preview. The Cogs have won every regular season meetup, but the Claws have won in the playoffs. This season the Claws are at the bottom of the Outlands so it's extra important to gain some ground on the Tatters who have already lost this week.

[[Aeson]] got the score tied as quickly as possible then sat out on defense for [[klim]] to get a shot at the development.
