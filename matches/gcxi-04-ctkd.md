# Tatters vs Dynamo

#t2775.3

Pick: Dynamo

Dynamo went in with a full roster, almost in playoff mode. They made a huge mistake thinking to maximize the casualties on the field in the first half and fucked up, leaving the half to end without stealing the TD they needed. And then that was it. The Tatters blitzed the second half with a short kick, tied up the ball and never let it go.

will the Tatters be able to bounce back and actually get a win

[[playoffrace]]
The Dynamo are the first of the teams that really need a win to have a chance at the CC after Week 5, especially after the Tide got a win and put the pressure on. That they couldn't hold on gave room for the Menace and Gore Farmers to get around them.
