# Runners vs Claws

#t2781.2

Pick: Claws+

The Claws couldn't catch a break early in this match. They kept the Sump Runners' lead down to 1 at the half, which at the time felt like a victory but when they couldn't convert off the second half kick things started looking really really bad. And then the injuries they'd been inflicting came home to roost and the Claws had tied it up.
