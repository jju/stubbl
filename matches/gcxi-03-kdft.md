# Dynamo vs Tide

#t2774.7

Pick: Even (KD)

[[Aleksy]] botched the opening pass of the match, giving the Dynamo an opening to score. Then [[Venus]] tripped on the goal line, giving the opening for a long [[Vardan]] to [[Louis]] connection. The set-play worked on their third go-round but that was not at all the first half they wanted.
