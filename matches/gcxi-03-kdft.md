# Dynamo vs Tide

#t2774.7

Pick: Even (KD)

[[Aleksy]] botched the opening pass of the match, giving the Dynamo an opening to score. Then [[Venus]] tripped on the goal line, giving the opening for a long [[Vardan]] to [[louis]] connection. The set-play worked on their third go-round but that was not at all the first half they wanted. The Dynamo kept things moving in the second half, happy to trade TDs with their comfortable lead, but then Venus had to play defense and from deep and safe in the backfield she spotted the ball come loose and made a mad dash to pick it up and even though she got swamped by tacklers she managed to squeeze through and bring the Tide to within 1. But their bench was depleted and they couldn't cover the field well enough to stop the Dynamo from padding the lead again.
