# Menace vs Farmers

#t2787.5

Pick: Menace+

The Farmers are throwing out another minor league team against the Menace, dipping well below the salary floor. The league is looking into financial penalties.

Going into halftime the Menace were only up 1-0, which wasn't at all what anyone expected. But both teams settled into their expected roles in the second half and balance was restored, and the Menace clinched the Outlands title.
