# Cogs vs Spectres

#t2784.4

Pick: Cogs+

The Spectres went in prepared and the Cogs looked a little lackadasical in the pregame warmup, but they started off the match in the rain with a patented IC Kick Blitz to put the Spectres on the back foot, but they managed to slip and slide their way up to the end zone. Things never got better for the Cogs. A surprisingly decisive victory for the Spectres against a team trying to win a division. That they stole [[alexandros]]' contract in the middle of it all adds insult to injury.

> Weather: Pouring Rain
> Toss: IC-Kick
