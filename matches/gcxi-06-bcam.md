# Claws vs Menace

#t2778.5

Pick: Claws

The Claws were a comedy of errors in the opening quarter. Cleve couldn't make a pass to save his life and the Menace capitalized on the mistakes. In the end the Claws managed to get back in it, but a riot cut the match short just before Aeson could get a tying TD.
