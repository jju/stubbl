# Claws vs Vagabonds

#t2773.1

Pick: Claws

The two last place teams after Week 1 surely won't last too long at the bottom of the standings. Klim got her knee smashed on her first trip down the sideline but Rong was right there to make the score. Olanrewaju was taken out on the next drive (by the crowd). Throughout the rest of the match the Claws could never overcome their personnel deficiencies and this was not a lot of fun to watch.
