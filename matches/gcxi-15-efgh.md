# Fatality vs Hounds

#t2787.9

Pick: Even

This was another possible Classic Conference final preview, and one that the Hounds hope occurs in an exact same manner. After exchanging TDs early the ballhawks came to play and sacks were flying. It doesn't really matter for the Fatality but the Hounds now claimed the Heaps division title and get to rest up before facing a Quarterfinal opponent.
