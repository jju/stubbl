# Hounds vs Runners

#t2784.1

Pick: Hounds

Ziba took over the Sardines lead against the Sump Runners and the Hounds took over the lead in the Heaps division. Will either of those leads last the week? This probably put the nail in the Runners chances to catch the Wyrms, unless the Wyrms continue to underperform.

[[Ziba]] needs a big game since [[Venus]] will be going against a defense-free Claws squad
