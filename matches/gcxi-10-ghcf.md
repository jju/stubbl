# Hounds vs Furies

#t2782.3

The Furies did their best to hack and slash at the Hounds' stars, but skill (on the pitch and in the medical bay) got the Hounds back to their winning ways.

The Furies are trying to play spoiler and basically just fuck up the Hounds. If they can get [[Ziba]] out of the picture that would be a huge team success.
