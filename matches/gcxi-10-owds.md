# Wyrms vs Spectres

#t2782.4

Pick: Wyrms+

The Spectres roll in with a new look on the chance they might need a playoff roster to be built. The Wyrms are in a similar situation, but the skill-level of the players knocking rust off leaves the Spectres in the dust. In the end though the Spectres managed to clog up the lanes the Wyrms needed and got a pretty convincing win, which doesn't make the Wyrms title defense look any less shaky.
