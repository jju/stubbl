# Eagles vs Runners

#t2778.1

Pick: Even

Ekua took to the field resplendent and had an easy first half. [[jacquetta]] tried to spoil the first half's Eagle control but Donato scooped the ball up after [[Rajendra]] showed that Ekua isn't the only blitzer they have. They cruised through the second half never really needing to let up against the last place team. The only downside is that Ekua didn't do much in tying the Green Cup longevity record.

> Weather: Nice
> Toss: SR-Receive
> Kickoffs: RE-Blitz (RE-1Half), SR-BrilliantCoachingRE (RE-2), RE-QuickSnap (Final)

counting stats and Ekua's tying the GP record (parallel with longevity in gangsterism)
