The Menace didn't seriously injure anyone this season.

In their last match the teams emerged with a draw [[gcxi-11-amic]], which is not an option now that we're in playoff time.

> Weather: Nice
> Toss: AM-Receive
> Kickoffs: IC-GettheRef (IC 1Half), AM-ThrowaRockAM (AM 1), AM-QuickSnap (IC 2), IC-GettheRef (AM 2Regulation), IC-GettheRef ()

The Menace lined up for a right-side flank with [[Laurel]], which is a pretty standard move for their quick-strike offense. [[Mattheo]] got off a deep kick making for slightly tougher passes to get things started. More passes=more chances for slip-ups. The pass went smoothly, and after a slight hesitation Bishop opened up a hole for Laurel, and then she stumbled just outside the endzone. [[Hrolfr]] grabbed the ball with the support of [[Pinja]] and then proceeded to head downfield. He spent most of the rest of the half in a protected bubble, safe from the attempted sacks from [[Vusala]] and [[Sanja]] and the Cogs simply ran down the clock so as not to have to go into halftime tied. Sometimes this doesn't work, but for the Cogs today it did. AM 0 - IC 1

[[Mackenzie]] was hit with a rock on the kickoff, which made Hrolfr need to change hist first look for the pass, and during the distraction, he botched the pickup. He recovered but by then the Menace had Georgina near the passing lane and she made the Interception-TD and tied up the match. AM 1 - IC 1

On the next drive things were going better for the Cogs and again they tried slowing things down, but Vusala broke the defenses and popped the ball loose. Incredibly [[Ingeborg]] messed up the pass to the streaking [[Georgina]]. The Cogs couldn't get a hand on the ball and then Gerogina messed up catching the retry from [[Ingeborg]]. [[Hrolfr]] swooped in from the safety position and though [[Sanja]] tried for the sack, he made it down field safely for the game-leading TD. AM 1 - IC 2

On the final kick of regulation [[Matheo]] couldn't pin it deep and Laurel had the speed to send the match to overtime. Bishop drew [[Zina]] out of Laurel's path and she scampered in for the TD. AM 2 - IC 2

OT began with a decent kick, but the gameplan was successful and Ingebrg got the ball to Laurel and she kept her footing the entire way and the Menace got their first Green Cup playoff win! AM 3 - IC 2
