# Cogs vs Wyrms

#t2775.7

Pick: Wyrms

The rivalry match began as such a match should, a mob-up with a dumpoff and poking a hole for a dangerous romp to a TD. On the kick the Wyrms got aggressive but couldn't finish the TD before Alexandros got it to midfield and the forgotten scrummers.

classic rivalry match

### playoff race

Both are fringe candidates for the Champions Circuit but need a win to stay even there. If the Cogs win by 2 they can get into second place with losses by the Menace and Farmers. The Wyrms just need a win for the same result.
