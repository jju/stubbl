The Spectres did win more games this season, including beating the Eagles. They did it with a better offense and worse defense. The Eagles were the casualty-inflicting leaders over the regular season and they will probably be looking to do a lot of that in this match.

The Eagles do their best to stick with handoffs instead of passing, even though the two teams have very similar completion rates. Will the Spectres be taking risks with an aerial game here?

The Spectres are more direct in getting the ball to the endzone, and have scored twice as many TDs this season.

The Eagles are a good team for getting sacks (and casualties, though the Spectres are pretty resilient) so if they can interfere with the touch-TD pipeline, they've got a shot at another playoff win.

In their last match (back in week 2 [[gcxi-02-reds]]) the Spectres pulled off a 2-1 win despite their weird early season lineup. Now the Eagles are playing with [[Percy]] instead of [[Jantine]] but they're also stocked with backups for their more fragile personnel. All in all, this has the makings of a classic.

The Eagles lined up with a slight left bias to deal with the Spectres' strong front line. After some scrumming around the cage the Spectres emerged with the ball and tried (according to their nature apparently to pass downfield). [[Bates]] scooped up the ball and headed for the endzone, but was sacked by [[Grid]]. [[Zdravko]] tried to get the ball downfield for the Spectres, but botched the pass. Eventually after a pile of back and forth in the middle of the field Grid made the long necessary pass to [[Ragnar]]... who stumbled trying to get away from the well-positioned [[Chibueze]] (this may have been his most significant Green Cup moment). Ragnar did get back on his feet and grabbed the ball, but Chibueze tracked him down and downed him again. Time ran out on the half and there was still no score. DS 0 - RE 0

[[Ross]] hadn't been revived to start the second half so the Spectres were going in short a Runner. They obviously wanted to score quickly to get a more versatile defense on the next drive. Would that lead to them overextending again? The Eagles took advantage of the Spectres' second guessing to rearrange their defense even more aggressively. The Spectres did punch a hole in the Eagles' line while [[Zdravko]] set up protected on the right sideline. As the scrum in the middle broke out a pass was loosed and who but [[Chibueze]] made the interception? He tried to slowly make his way towards the endzone, marked by [[Blodeuwedd]]. Chibueze being the only one on the Eagles who can Dodge came in handy preventing a sack! He was subsequently pushed into the crowd and the ball got out for [[Channing]] to recover. Channing was a little scattered and almost set out the wrong way down the field, but got herself together. She lost the ball, then got it back then fumbled the pickup, leaving [[Donato]] clear to grab it. Meanwhile [[Percy]] killed [[Henry]] back in the middle of the field, factoring inabsolutely zero on the way the meat of the match was going. [[Ragnar]] got a sack and managed to grab the ball but couldn't get to the endzone before he was ganged up on by [[Bates]] and [[Jonquil]], who killed him. Channing dashed to the endzone with [[Persis]] following to do the shovel pass the Spectres needed to complete for the win, which she succeeded at! DS 1 - RE 0

The final kick was more for show and for the Spectres to get the adulation of their fans. Losing [[Ragnar]] was heartbreaking but the victory remained sweet. DS 1 - RE 0
