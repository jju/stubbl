# Eagles vs Vagabonds

#t2772.8

Pick: ZV

The Eagles go into this match with room to establish themselves again as Iron Fist difference makers. They dropped any receivers focusing entirely on the run against a soft looking Vagabond line, and it played out well enough. There was some trouble in the backfield early in the second half but the Eagles did some excellent work containing it and [[donato]] got the insurance TD out of it. RE 2 - ZV 0

The Eagles have won the Iron Fist award the past two seasons and Jantine has been an important part of that, so you watched the beginning of the eleventh Green Cup season with a lot of anticipation since this could be the match that Jantine takes over from [[Somfuhr]] on top of the all-time Casualty leaderboard. The team was ready for celebrating the milestone and managed the match perfectly to come out with an underdog win as well.
