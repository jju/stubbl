# Eagles vs Fatality

#t2784.8

Pick: Fatality

The Fatality had a nice little romp and [[Percy]] got a couple more Casualtiesunder his belt in the hopes the Eagles will be playing in the post-season (which is now slightly in doubt). Losing [[Dunstan]] could be a problem for their post-season run.

> Weather: Nice
> Toss: EF-Receive
> Kickoffs: RE-QuickSnap (EF 1), EF-Blitz (EF 2), EF-ChangingWeatherNice (Half), EF-CheeringFansEF (Final)
