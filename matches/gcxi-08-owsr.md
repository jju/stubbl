Pick: Wyrms+

[[Zalmon]] and [[Martti]] hooked up at the end of the first half to give the Wyrms the lead going into the second after the Sump Runners came very close to a dangerous move. In the end the Runners managed a defensive score to tie up the game and the Wyrms continue underperforming expectations.
