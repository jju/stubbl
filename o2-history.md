# history of the BRL

## caveat

I can't claim anything like being on the ground floor of the development of the BRL. For a lot of my readers that might be enough to discount this piece of work. I understand that. There is an wuthenticity of information that comes from being immersed in the creation of something, of the actual work day in and day out to create something where there was nothing.

But I argue with my skeptical aggressive readers who hate everything a person might try to create. I am a fool that way I suppose.

The approach we're taking here is that of a fairly clear-eyed nonpartisan, I hope. I do know it can't be. When I was writing up the gangwars of Stacksburg people accused me of being anti-religious and not sensitive enough to the plights of the anti-civilization renegades we have in these parts. Even using the term renegades is implying an allegiance with the staus quo. I understand that. But this is the language I have and that I can use. There are greater forces at work in the up above and I know that writing about them through the lens of sport is going to trivialize everything I try to put down, this is what I am trying.

Anon, this direct authorial intervention grows tiresome I am sure.

## CBL

Up above, the Colonial Bludbol League [CBL] is the only version of the sport that matters. There are junior leagues and educational leagues but those are primarily focused on funneling the most talented players into the CBL. I admit I haven't spent a huge amount of time above, but the impression we get down here is that everything that is not the CBL is a mediocre facsimile.

In the CBL there are very impressive stadiums and fans and huge amounts of money are made every year. The amount of control exerted on the players is immense because of the value each franchise commands. Scandals erupt when a player isn't exactly "on message" through the offseason, and that message is one of hyper-aggression and obsession with competition. CBL players are expected to identify wholly with their team. There are no trades, only firings. Once a player is done in the CBL they are blackballed from playing with anyone ever again. Hence the development of the minor leagues.

## cast-off leagues

There are leagues where players who've retired can make their money. Part of the scandal of CBL Bludbol is that since there is such a premium placed on channelling only the best up and up to the pinnacle of the sport the players who end up falling short are left out of much of the rest of society. Their education hasn't been developed to the same degree as their peers.

The cast-off leagues are always seen as a lesser version of the CBL sport. Some of them have modified rulesets that are more or less forgiving for players and their weaknesses that knocked them out of the pinnacle ranks of the sport. The player-friendly leagues have different equipment types which lead to fewer injuries, while the rabid leagues foster a much more anything goes, kill 'em all, approach.

> "I can't say I was any hot shakes in the BRL but man, when I got cut, the piranhas came out to feed. The teams they've got representatives who come to you, sometimes right out of the medics' hut and they're all 'you know you aren't appreciated here. Let us know when you want to make some real scratch.' They show a bit of bankroll and maybe take you to dinner. A few of my teammates got a couple of meals out of these assholes, but I never could do it. I didn't really trust myself not to get sucked in."

> "You know, it feels a lot like it did back when they pulled you off the street in the first place. Somewhere to sleep, get a screen for your vids and all you've got to do is keep on playing the game you're getting pretty okay at. Of course, after you're let go they come a bit more hardcore, all the 'How're you gonna eat now? You have no skills for anything but smacking punkasses down.' So yeah, some people get pulled into that. Like really, 50k per season? That can go a long way in the Stacks. And if you get too used to it, you're kind of fucked."

Once a player has dipped their toes in the cast-off waters official CBL won't come anywhere near them. Greezle Mikhof [GMH] was a star receiver up above but when she got cut for being an inefficient investment (and that's in the big money no salary cap environment) she wasn't content to sit on her laurels and wait for the Hall of Fame people to come knocking. Greezle was a true Boller and played a season in the Asymmetric Warfare League [AWL]. It was a good career move for her. She led the Howling Gryphons to 2 championships under a sobriquet rouge. CBL officials figured out her game after the first trophy went to the Gryphons and told her right then that she would never make the CBL hall. She never did.

## gryj the hun and the birth of the bottom rung

With cast-off leagues having such a stigma attached to them, it seemed impossible for Stacksburg to ever be able to organize their fans and investors into something that would attract a decent level of competition. Most burgers contented themselves with CBL matches on the screen and streetbol in the neighbourhood.

That was before Gryj the Hun.

Gryj does not look like bludbol. She's not athletic enough to be mistaken for a player, not personable enough to be a cheerleader, not wealthy enough to be an owner, and not even frothy enough to be a fan. But Gryj had a plan.

"The genius of Gryj is that she didn't try and whip up a frenzy. She just asked a lot of questions."

Gryj grew up in the Stacks and in her (vaguely hagiographical) official biography she is listed as never doubting for a second that she loved the sport of bludbol. A weak lung condition meant she was never very capable at playing, getting winded long before a drive was over even at the pace of the schoolyard. But she was good at watching, and possibly more important she was good at keeping track of things.

In her educational years she spent most of her time paying attention to marking down statistics and lumping them together. She would watch the lowliest streetbol match with a stopwatch and notebook open at all times. Gryj didn't see the game the way a novice or even an experienced fan does, she saw it slowed right down.

She gave unsolicited advice to everyone, about the tendencies of competitive players and she was often right. Not enough to draw attention to herself but people who knew the game knew her as a kindred spirit.

> Story about bludbol being a random random sport. 1/6 chance of everything going aces or pearshaped at any given moment. There's no nice creamy middle where talent shows through.

That would all be well and good but it wouldn't have changed bludbol in the Stacks, if Gryj wasn't a persistent mofo.

When she started working she didn't want to just coach a team. There was absolutely no money in the shittiness of amateur level bludbol. The sharks of the cast-off ;eagues circled but Gryj could see the problems in dealing with people so hungry to return to the graces of the overleagues. What she needed was a way to bring the skills down to the Stacks.

She pestered and pestered and pestered, asking questions of lawyers about what exactly it was about the cast-offs that made them so unpalatable to the CBL. Was it the gambling? The lack of safety? Too much safety? The lack of name recognition? Did they want a more fungible product that could sell on the screens? Did they need more local connection? It wasn't hard to find examples of all sorts of differences between the cast-offs and the bigs, but none of them was enough to get her the answers she wanted. What she wanted to know was "How do I create an affiliate of your league?"

Plenty of people at the CBL argued that they should just demand an extraordinary outlay of cash and let Gryj bankrupt herself in trying to create something to compete with their juggernaut. What exactly would be the harm? But the powers that were knew about the power of branding. If deep in the belly of the beast there was a bludbol league that wasn't being ruthlessly ground down, then people might get uppity about all kinds of things. No it was better to stick to the principles of exploitation they'd developed and manipulate their talent as they knew how to do. The cash grab wouldn't be worth it.

But then came Gryj's secret. Statistics. With no money and only the help of a pack of volunteers, Gryj was compiling numbers on everyone who handled a bludbol. Though the players were all terrible, Gryj could tell them exactly what was going wrong and right for them. Not all of them were developing, but a few would. To get great in the amateur leagues took time and match after match after match. Down in Stacksburg the kids were getting these matches in.

The idea that Gryj's monitoring regimen could help players who'd been through the CBL development ranks was a tenacious one in her mind at least. It had to be as it sustained her for nearly 40 years.

> need stories of how this got applied in the pre-BRL days.
> hardship? grinding poverty? general bullshit in the intervening times? Maybe this is where Sacksburg, though it had been a good hardworking region starts to get shat upon. we put in our parallel to the titanic sinking and how it bollocks up the development of teams even as the population is exploding and densifying. really we're talking about a slumworld but one with very sharp-eyed undernourished people

The first season of the Bottom Rung League had 8 teams. The population of the Stacks around that time was in the low 8 digits, massively overshadowed by the world above, but there was talent. Gryj couldn't get everywhere and amassed a coterie of other coaches and scouts who bought into the techniques of evaluation.

### CBL as stodgy

At the time the BRL began, the CBL had 6 general playbooks teams followed. The BRL encouraged issuing challenges to the standard rulebook and were soon supporting 20 approaches to the game (at least in the developmental leagues). It may be worth noting that none of the winners of the Green Cup have been using CBL playbooks, and two of the playbooks have never had pro circuit representation.

> "You see, the CBL game is great. Those superstars are amazeballs, but the strategy, man, that's where you lose out. I'd say the fundamentals of bludbol are in adaptation to shitty circumstances, and that's just not how they roll up there. Everyone has backup plans to the backup plans. Ozymandias would fit in great up there because yeah, he's a surgeon with his tosses, but yeesh. Half the CBL teams just cage up and use every drive as an excuse to pound the shit out of each other. They're entertaining as hell while they do it, but there are only so many standard 2-1 wins a fan can stomach, right? You need the unpredictability mixed with skill. That's what I love about bludbol." - some fan.
