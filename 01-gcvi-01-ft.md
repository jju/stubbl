So you settle into the EDS to watch the {$followingTeam} play some bludbol. Their first match is against the Irregular Cogs.

The game goes faster than you expected, and it's really hard to tell exactly what's going on. It looks like the feeds are just security footage from cameras suspended at weird angles over the field. Everything is washed out and blurry or overblown when the players end up just under a light. 

After a few big re-oredering of the players after one of the orange and blue-clad players went scampering up the sidelines, you figured out that the Tide seem to be faster and better at scoring than the Cogs. Without any explanation on the screen and barely any sound, the whole thing was weirdly unsatisfying.

In the end the {$followingTeam} won 5-0, though you had to look it up on the message boards afterwards. It was only on the boards afterwards that you learned [[Chomps]] had actually killed one of the Cogs' rookie throwers.

It sounds like these are going to be the most interesting players to watch, or at least the ones the message-boarders are most excited about.

* [[Fikri]] - Thrower
* [[Chomps]] - Old-Era Veteran Blitzer
* [[Iapheth]] - Catcher
* [[Silas]] - Thrower

So that was a week of bludbol. What now?

You watch 6 more weeks of terrible video-quality {$followingTeam} bludbol on the EDS. Most of the time you have no idea what is going on.

They beat the Glorious Hounds 3-2 in week two and the Ravenous Eagles 4-1, before losing 1-0 to the Carcosan Tatters. They got a 2-2 draw with the Vagabonds and lost 3-2 to the Gore Farmers before losing 3-2 to the Old Wyrms to close out the first half of the season.

Now there's word that another BludBol league is starting up in Stacksburg. Some of the other old-era teams that had been left out of this tournament are organizing to play for the "real" green cup.

What now?

And that's the season.

The Tatters started off the second half with a 3-0 loss to the Irregular Cogs then scored the most you'd ever seen with a 3-0 win against the Old Wyrms. A grinding 1-0 loss to the Ravenous Eagles was followed by a 2-1 win against the Glorious Hounds. Then they had a big 4-0 loss to the Zensun Vagabonds, and a 2-1 loss to the Filthy Tide. A 3-0 win against the Gore Farmers finished off the season.
